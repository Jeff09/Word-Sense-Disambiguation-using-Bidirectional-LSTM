They were seen to succeed in living a sexually pure life as part of this .  There was some extension of the pietistic ideal .  Sodalities , such as the Legion of Mary , Opus Dei , and Christian Life communities , have partially extended this form of commitment to some , particularly more middle - class laity , and continue to have an important role in <head>activating</head> laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially . But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .

Gilbert refers to a dissertation by Richard Allen Soloway which shows contemporary fears of Christianity falling before the atheistical ,  licentious ,  and immoral foreigner  ( Sexual Deviance and Disaster ,  98 ,  99 ,  1001 ,  11011 )  .  The sodomite becomes a virulent image of this threat ,  embodying a foreign infection which in turn is linked to social disorder and economic collapse at home .  A violent , enduring mythology is <head>activated</head> to make sense of immediate socio - political crisis and fear . This analysis suggests that if ,  in periods of intensified conflict ,  crisis is displaced on to the deviant ,  the process only succeeds because of the paranoid instabilities at the heart of dominant cultural identities .  Further ,  such displacements of non - sexual fears on to the sexual deviant ,  be he or she actual ,  imagined ,  or constituted in and by the displacement ,  are made possible because other kinds of transgression  political ,  religious  are not only loosely associated with the sexual deviant ,  but condensed in the very definition of deviance .

For Zuwaya or Magharba ,  the largest group which had common descent for practical purposes was a tribe .

Qaddafi ,  however ,  thinks of nations as permanently active groups in continual session ,  not disappearing from practice when they are not needed .  They are the chief motor of history ,  undermining artificial creations such as states which attempt to impose solidarities on people ,  to claim their lives and property ,  for political or economic or military purposes .

After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA  (  N  methyl - D - aspartate )  receptors were activated or not. A stronger ( long ) serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which <head>activate</head> the NMDA receptors , leading to long term memory . A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .  The team also found that long term potentiation led to the persistent elevation of cAMP in the cells ,  while short term potentiation was associated with only a transient elevation of cAMP .

The suggestion that pre - exposure to a stimulus establishes an exact representation of it ,  for instance ,  is not in itself enough to explain latent inhibition ;  indeed it seems capable of predicting quite the wrong result .  The ability of the CS to evoke the CR after conditioning trials have been given will depend ,  in part ,  upon that stimulus being identified with the one that was presented during conditioning .  To the extent that this identification is more likely to be made when the stimulus in question is already capable of <head>activating</head> a detailed representation , the likelihood of a vigorous CR may be increased . What we have already seen ,  however ,   ( p. 24 )  is that pre - exposure to the to - be - CS results in retarded  development of the CR .  Clearly ,  this aspect of our account of habituation is not enough in itself to explain the latent inhibition effect .

This is what has been claimed for an alternative associative account put forward by McLaren ,  Kaye ,  and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  .  This theory develops the convergence  ( also noted by others ,  e.g. Sutton and Barto 1981 ;  Gluck and Bower 1988 )  between standard associative models and connectionist systems of parallel distributed processing  ( e.g. Rumelhart ,  Hinton ,  and McClelland 1986 )  and it is intended to apply to a range of phenomena in perceptual learning .  For our present purposes , however , the important feature of the model is that it develops the implications of the widely accepted notion that even the simplest stimulus will consist of a set ( probably a large number ) of elements and that only some of these will be sampled ( will <head>activate</head> their central representations ) on a given exposure ( cf. Estes 1950 ;  Neimark and Estes 1967 )  .  Latent inhibition is held to be a consequence of the formation of associations among these elements .

All the accounts of latent inhibition discussed so far have assumed that what is learned during pre - exposure interferes with the formation of the CS - US association .  Revusky  ( 1971 )  call his theory a concurrent  interference theory to emphasize just this point and to distinguish it from another commonly held interpretation of proactive interference .  According to this alternative view , the target association may be formed perfectly normally but since , on a subsequent test trial , both this and any previously learned association will become <head>activated</head> when the CS is presented , the subjects may fail to retrieve the correct one and the likelihood of the CR will be reduced . Indeed ,  the effects of retrieval failure may also be evident during the course of conditioning itself because any trial after the first can be viewed as being a test trial on which the subject is required to retrieve information acquired on earlier trials .  Clearly the retrieval - failure hypothesis will make many of the same predictions as other theories of latent inhibition .

One possibility that follows from Wagner 's   ( 1981 )  theory is that the magnitude of the CR might actually be enhanced .  In the context used for training ,  contextual cues will be able to establish an A2 )   ( secondary activation )  representation of the CS thereby limiting the ability of the stimulus itself to evoke Al  ( primary activation )  .  In a different context , however , the CS will be able to evoke Al and since the Al state is better than A2 at <head>activating</head> an associative link , the CS will be better able to elicit its CR when the context is changed . There may be other associative effects ,  however ,  and these allow the possibility that a change of context might reduce the likelihood of the CR .  In particular ,  associations will also be formed between the context and the US ,  allowing the former to come to elicit ,  at least to some degree ,  the CR evoked by the nominal CS .

Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .  Subsequent training with A followed by an unconditioned stimulus  ( US )  might allow the formation of an association between the associatively activated representation of X and the US .  Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation ( and of evoking a CR ) by way of its ability to <head>activate</head> the X representation . A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively activated representation can form an excitatory link with the  ( directly activated )  representation of some other event .

The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean ,  in terms of the figure ,  an increase in the number of a  and b  elements activated by the stimuli ,  something that can be represented diagrammatically in more than one way .  Figure 5.11 ( b ) shows an increase in the areas a and b with a consequent reduction in the proportion ( although not the absolute number ) of c elements <head>activated</head> by a stimulus . figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements activated by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart ,  indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements activated by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements activated .

Transmitters and mediators The transmitter substances which we described in chapters 4 and 6 provided a valuable basis from which to start searching for new drugs .  Dale and his colleagues in the 1930s showed that acetylcholine , in addition to its other properties , was a local hormone relaying messages at autonomic ganglia , that is at critical points in the nerve pathways which control the heart and blood vessels , and at the sites where nerves <head>activate</head> voluntary muscles . The first drugs which could be relied on to reduce the dangerously high arterial pressure which precedes strokes and heart failure were substances which blocked the actions of acetylcholine at these ganglia ,  and so prevented the passage of nervous messages which put up the blood pressure .  A series of synthetic compounds ,  with a long pedigree going back to the work of Crum Brown and Fraser in the 1860s  ( see chapter 2 )  ,  were produced simultaneously by R. B. Barlow and H. R. Ing in the Pharmacology Laboratory at Oxford and by W. D. M.  ( later Sir William )  Paton and Eleanor Zaimis at the National Institute for Medical Research .

However ,  extracellular calcium is necessary and there is considerable evidence ,  particularly from studies of thrombasthenic platelets ,  that the platelet surface glycoproteins IIb and III are involved  ( Nurden  Caen ,  1974 ,  1975 ;  Phillips  Agin ,  1977 )  .  More recently ,  fibrinogen has been strongly implicated in platelet - platelet interactions .  Platelets <head>activated</head> by thrombin were found to produce haemagglutinin activity with fixed bovine erythrocytes ( Gartner et al , 1980 ) , and subsequently the same group have shown that this agglutinin is bound to platelet membranes and appears in the incubation fluid following platelet activation by thrombin ( Gartner et al , 1980 ) . It is highly likely that this agglutinin is fibrinogen  ( Gartner et al ,  1980 ;  Berndt  Phillips ,  1981 )  .  Indeed ,  the role of fibrinogen in platelet aggregation has been recognised for many years  ( Born  Cross ,  1964 ;  Brinkhaus et al ,  1965 )  .

The area has been subject to Cimmerian rift - faulting but has suffered additional severe inversion and wrench - related movements associated with the edge of the Broad Fourteens Basin .  The Ijmuiden Ridge is highlighted as a possible structural influence in a manner analogous to the Dowsing Fault - Zone .  The Ijmuiden Ridge forms the southern edge of the inverted Broad Fourteens Basin and has the characteristics of a line of complex re - <head>activated</head> fault movement . Hercynian influences are largely obscured by the later structural effects ,  but as a result of the improved quality of seismic data ,  some important aspects of pre - Permian structure have been defined .  With the exception of the London - Brabant Massif ,  the structural form is considered to be largely independent of the Mesozoic structure described above .

Recent research in tumour promotion backs up this objection .  Tumour promoters are substances such as the phorbolesters that are n't carcinogenic by themselves but encourage the growth of malignant tumours in cells that have previously been exposed to a low dose of a true carcinogen  ( known as an initiator )  .  Researchers have now discovered that even by themselves , promoters can stimulate cells to produce <head>activated</head> forms of oxygen , known as free radicals . These can damage DNA .  Promoters presumably would fall within Albert 's  nongenotoxic or epigenetic category ,  a daunting prospect to those who favour erring on the side of safety .

Carcinogens awaken sleeping genes CANCER cells are almost by definition cells that have escaped from the controls that govern the behaviour of the individual cells in a multicellular organism .  And recent research has dramatically shown that one way for them to make the break is through the activation of cellular oncogenes genes that are more or less inactive in normal cells hut seem to be altered or <head>activated</head> in tumour cells ( New Scientist , vol 96 , p418 . Now two Americans ,  Vincent Wilson and Peter Jones at the University of Southern California ,  have evidence that one of the actions of cancer - causing chemicals may be to jam the mechanism that normally keeps these genes  as well as other cellular genes  under control .  The mechanism thee were looking at is a chemical modification of the DNA known as methylation .

Hayward and his collaborators are among those to have reported this discovery in ANAS  ( vol 79 ,  p 7842 )  ;  they ,  and a collaborative team led by Bob Gallow of the US National  Institutes  of Health and Carlo Croce of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ,  have shown that the myc  gene is strategically placed at the breakpoint where the translocated fragment of chromosome 8 links up with chromosome 14 in lymphoma cells .  At the same time ,  Phil Ledler ,  Stuart Aaronson and G. Lenoir have gone further and shown that in Burkitt 's  lymphoma cells the myc  gene becomes linked with DNA - encoding parts of the antibody molecule .  But while these reports neatly confirm Kein 's and Hayward 's ideas about the activation of proto - oncogenes in leukaemias and lymphomas , they have also helped to unleash a surprisingly violent controversy about how the proto - oncogene is <head>activated</head> . Harvard 's  experiments on bird tumours ,  for example ,  showed that viral insertion increased the expression of the myc  gene  and Croce and his collaborators reported that they found increased expression of myc  in Burkin 's  lymphomas  ( Science  ,  vol 21 8 ,  p 983 )  .  But others have failed to find such quantitative increases ,  and suspect instead that in the course of translocation ,  the alene is altered in a way that causes a qualitative change in its product .

SATURATED hydrocarbons  ( alkanes )  such as methane and ethane contain the strongest known carbon - hydrogen bonds ;  bonds that are notoriously difficult to break in a controlled way .  Now chemists have discovered several compounds of transition metals such as tungsten and iridium that can split an alkane carbon - hydrogen bond to form a carbon - metal bond instead .  Once attached to a metal , an alkane is <head>activated</head> : it is easier to convert into other useful organic chemicals . The abundance of alkanes makes them particularly attractive starting materials for industrial processes .  The enormous stocks of methane under the North sea are mainly used for fuel  natural gas .

Bergman used his iridium compound in a sequence of reactions to demonstrate how to convert an alkane into an iodine derivative called an alkyl iodide .  Organic chemists can change alkyl iodides into almost any other products they want .  Although these transition metal compounds will <head>activate</head> carbon - hydrogen bonds , they do not behave catalytically , and so are of limited practical value . A catalyst facilitates a chemical process without being used up or changed itself .  Bergman 's  iridium compound ,  for example ,  is itself chemically altered during the alkyl iodode reaction .

The concrete meaning of the word in ordinary language is in fact breath ,  and the alternations of breathing out and in are the paradigms for the ch'i  in its active phase moving ,  expanding ,   rarefying  as the Yang ,  and in its passive phase reverting to stillness ,  contracting ,  solidifying ,  as the Yin .

This has been an important influence in promoting a communicative approach to the teaching of languages .  It should be noted ,  however ,  that the rationale for such an approach relates primarily to the ends and not the means of learning ,  and is directed at furthering the cause of cultural co - operation in Europe .  The original concern for out - of - school education is evident in the way objectives are defined in terms of utility . : threshold level specifications are drawn up with an eye to meeting the needs of learners as eventual participants in contexts of communicative interaction , rather than with a concern to <head>activate</head> the actual learning process itself . Their relevance outside the situation for which they were designed ,  where eventual aims  cannot be so readily related to learning objectives ,  should not therefore be taken on trust  ( see Widdowson 1983 )  .  But it has been commonly supposed that specifications along threshold level lines must be universally relevant ,  without reference to the definition of objectives for learning on which the original threshold level specifications are based.

It will be clear that on any particular occasion of meaning negotiation the more familiar the schematic content or mode of communication ,  the less reliance needs to be placed on systemic knowledge ,  and vice versa .  If ,  for example ,  I am engaged in reading a text on a subject in which I am well versed  ( where the ideational or content schema is familiar )  ,  which has been written in a manner conventionally associated with writing on this subject  ( where the interpersonal or formal schema is familiar )  ,  then I shall only need to pay attention to the linguistic signs to the extent that they key in this schematic knowledge and indicate how it is to be extended .  Many of the specific meanings which can be deciphered out of the symbol are not <head>activated</head> because they are not indexically required . This ,  of course ,  relates to the point made by Johnson - Laird earlier :  that an effective  ( i.e. indexical )  use of language does not depend on knowing precise  ( i.e. symbolically complete )  meanings .  On the other hand ,  if I encounter a text which deals with an unfamiliar content area and does so in accordance .  with communicative or rhetorical conventions which are new to me ,  then I obviously have to look much more closely at the language itself as a source of information as to what might be meant .

The question that  then needed to be answered was whether the dd  fusion was being induced by collisions within the hot plasma  thermonuclear fusion  or from some other non - thermonuclear processes such as collisions between deuterons that had been accelerated to high energies during the initial pulse of current and other deuterons of comparatively low energies .

According to Marslen - Wilson and Welsh ,  a set of potential word candidates  ( the cohort )  is activated during the earliest phases of the word recognition process solely on the basis of bottom - up sensory information .  That is ,  all words sharing the same initial sound characteristics become activated in the system .  As the system detects mismatches between initial bottom - up sensory information and the top - down information about the expected sound representation of words generated by context , inappropriate candidates within the initial cohort are de - <head>activated</head> . A word is said to be recognised at the point when a particular word can be uniquely distinguished from all other words in the cohort .

The second chest has an identical trap ,  save that this time the poison in the darts is Elfbane ,  and it has a second trap which will be activated only if the chest is forcibly opened .  Inside this chest is a delicate glass globe packed with Yellow Mould spores ,  and if the chest is tipped up ,  broken  into ,  etc. ,  this will release its deadly contents in a 10 - yard radius .  If the adventurers are successful in picking the lock , this trap wo n't be <head>activated</head> , but they will have to be very careful taking out the money without breaking the glass sphere ( no test needed , but you should roll dice as if you were making some secret test just to scare the players ) . The sphere is much too delicate for the adventurers to carry  ( e.g. ,  to use as a weapon )  .  The third chest has a slightly decayed ,  but permanent ,  Magic Lock on it ,  such that an attempt at mechanical lock - picking is only 50 %  likely to be successful even if the lock - picker makes his Dex  test to pick the lock .

Indeed ,  for most of human history we have tended to do the reverse ,  to use the analogy of the human mind to explain what happens in the physical world ,  an approach known as animism .  By the seventeenth century ,  however ,  engineers had become sufficiently skilled at making complex mechanical devices ,  powered by clockwork or water ,  to be able to make toys that moved in a fairly convincing approximation to the way that people and animals move .  Some were constructed so that they would only move when a passing person <head>activated</head> a treadle of some sort so that the toy would suddenly spring into life . The French mathematician Descartes remarked on the similarity between this sort of toy and the behaviour of animals ,  arguing that the latter were nothing more than automatons whose reactions were constantly triggered by events in the environment  ( Jeannerod 1985 )  .  Not knowing about electricity ,  but knowing about hydraulic systems ,  Descartes suggested that the control of these reactions in animals was mediated by movements of fluids ,  initiated in the sensory nerves by stimuli ,  being carried to the ventricular system of the brain where contact was made with the motor nerves .

Indeed ,  their emotional behaviour was often exaggerated .  Papez therefore located the emotional behaviour mechanisms in the brainstem ,  especially in the mammillary bodies which ,  he believed ,  received sensory information via subcortical relay routes ,  and cognitive information from the cerebral cortex via the hippocampus and its subcortical projection system ,  the fornix .  Emotional experience , on the other hand , he thought was the result of <head>activating</head> specific areas of the cerebral cortex in much the same way as activating other areas produced visual or auditory experience . On the basis of some remarkably weak clinical evidence he decided that the site of emotional experience was the cingulate gyrus ,  which lies on the medial surface of the hemispheres .  All of the areas that Papez implicated in emotion are part of an anatomically identified system known  as the limbic system .

It is wrong because you can eliminate all of the possible sensory mechanisms that might detect the tissue disturbance produced by a particular form of deprivation and motivation still persists .  For example ,  cutting the nerve supply to the genitals does not interfere with sexual motivation in the short term ;  cutting the nerves to the stomach does not interfere with hunger .  This led Morgan ( 1943 ) to argue that drive must be due to <head>activating</head> a central nervous system mechanism that represents the drive state , much in the same way as Papez was claiming that activation of the cingulate cortex represented emotion . Morgan did not know where to locate the source of this central motive state in the nervous system .  It was Stellar  ( 1954 )  who put the finger on the hypothalamus as the seat of motivation ,  basing his arguments on a number of lesion studies that had shown quite specific disturbances of motivation after lesions in this region .

The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator activates the output neuron simultaneously with external activation of the input neuron .  After a number of such pairings a particular pattern of input will come to evoke a selected output pattern , without the output pattern generator being <head>activated</head> . Associative learning will have taken place .  This system is ,  by  definition ,  interactive since every input neuron can affect every output neuron .

This process of building up internal representations turns out to be considerably more complicated than was initially thought .  Our eyes are not cameras ,  our ears are not tape - recorders ,  faithfully but passively recording what is in the outside world .  The physical events that <head>activate</head> our sense organs are already imperfect versions of the properties of objects that we wish to know about . For example ,  the perceived colours of objects are only loosely related to the wavelengths of light that they reflect into our eyes .

This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and ,  at each location ,  determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to activate single cells at that location .  You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are <head>activated</head> by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field . The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .  It has been known since the turn of the century that the primary visual cortex must be retinotopically mapped .

The HER - 2/neu  oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase ,  p185 erbB2    ( ref .  32 )  ,  which is structurally related to the EGF receptor and to erbB3  ( ref .  34 )  .  Additionally ,  p185 erbB2   is expressed on the surface of Schwann cells and is upregulated during wallerian degeneration and also by exposure to forskolin ,  which potentiates the mitogenic response to GGF .  As the recombinant GGFs described here and several putative p185 erbB2 ligands are products of the same gene , we reasoned that bovine pituitary GGFs and rhGGF - II might <head>activate</head> a p185 receptor tyrosine kinase ( perhaps erbB2 ) on Schwann cells . Therefore we analysed tyrosine phosphorylation of Schwann cell protein by western blotting  ( Fig. 3 )  .  This demonstrated that Schwann cells treated with either native or recombinant GGFs phosphorylated  ( on tyrosine )  a protein of 185K .

Using peptide sequence information derived from purified bovine glial growth factors ,  we have isolated several clones that encode Schwann cell mitogenic activities .  The group of proteins encoded by these transcripts includes the three described glial growth factors  ( ref .  22 ,  and A.D.J.G .  et al. ,   manuscript submitted )  and several proteins  ( heregulins and Neu differentiation factor )  that have various activities on cultured breast tumour cells .  The heregulins and NDF are specific activators of the p185 erbB2 receptor and rhGGF - II <head>activates</head> the phosphorylation of a Schwann cell protein that is similar in size to p185 erbB2 . Based on several lines of evidence ,  including the data presented here ,  we suggest that various p185 erbB2  ligands ,  such as the GGFs ,  are important in development ,  regeneration and tumour formation in the nervous system .  A critical stage in the development of the peripheral nervous system is the projection of axons to their targets ,  the ensheathment of these axons and their subsequent myelination by Schwann cells .

This is consistent with the idea that DNA binding and therefore transactivation by Myc requires association with Max  ( either Max1 or Max2 )  or at least the Max bHLH - Z domain  ( Max85 ;  Figs 1 and 2 a  )  .  Unlike VP16 - Myc  N ,  Max103 - VP16 by itself transactivates the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter  ( Fig. 2 b  )  .  Thus , Max can bind DNA in the absence of Myc but does not significantly <head>activate</head> transcription in our system unless tagged with a heterologous transactivation domain . Accordingly ,  all Max proteins tested  ( Fig. 1 )  bind DNA as homo - oligomers in yeast extracts  ( ref .  9 ,  and data not shown )  ,  as recently reported for bacterially expressed Max .  Transactivation of the CACGTG - CYC1 promoter is sequence - specific ,  as much less or no transactivation by Myc+Max  ( Fig. 2 a  ,  lanes a )  ,  VP16 - Myc  N+Max or Max103 - VP16  ( Fig. 2 b  )  is observed from a control reporter lacking the CACGTG binding site  ( see also Fig. 2 a  legend )  .

A purse - string mechanism based on a contractile cable fits the observations of others who have investigated embryonic wound healing and seen similar patterns of epidermal movement .  But it does not apply to minute epidermal lesions that leave the basal lamina intact ,  or to embryonic epidermal cells moving on a rigid adhesive substratum in culture :  here the conventional mechanism of epidermal crawling seems to operate .  Two central questions arise : what initiates the formation of the actin cable , and what <head>activates</head> its contraction and the associated cell rearrangements ? The experiments of Kolega are illuminating here .  Stress applied to a migrating epidermal cell at right angles to its direction of movement  ( tangential to the leading edge of its lamellipodium )  causes the lamellipodium to retract and brings about a reorganization of the cell 's  actin into a cable oriented along the major axis of stress .

These findings ,  together with our previous observation of an unidentified   t   - resistant PLC in HL - 60 granulocytes and our unpublished observation that purified PLC -   1  showed no response to   t  ,  strongly suggest that the stimulation of PLC -  2  by   t  is specific for members of the PLC -    subfamily and is isozyme - selective within this group of PLCs .  Clearly , PLC - 1 is <head>activated</head> by all four members of the q family ( q , 11 , 14 , and 16 ) . PLC -  2  seems to be resistant to stimulation by   q  ,   11  ,   and  14  ,   but sensitive to stimulation by  16    ( refs 9 ,  10 )  .  Our finding that both PLC -  1  and PLC -  2  are stimulated by   subunits strongly suggests that these PLCs ,  similar to the type II and IV adenylyl cyclases ,  are regulated by both G protein  -   and   subunits .

The significance of these protocols is that synchronized firing patterns at similar frequencies occur in the hippocampus during learning .  )  LTP is characterized by three basic properties :  cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity .  Cooperativity describes the existence of an intensity threshold for induction ; weak tetani , <head>activating</head> relatively few afferent fibres , do not trigger LTP . The threshold for inducing LTP is a complex function of the intensity and pattern of tetanic stimulation ;  between weak trains which produce only PTP and strong trains which induce LTP ,  lies an intermediate range of activation which engages STP .  LTP is associative in the sense that a weak input can be potentiated if it is active at the same time as a strong tetanus to a separate but convergent input .

The properties of cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity can now easily be explained .  The cooperativity threshold follows from the need for depolarization to reduce the level of the Mg 2+  block of the NMDA channel .  Weak stimuli , activating only a few fibres , fail to induce LTP not because insufficient L - glutamate is released to <head>activate</head> NMDA receptors , but because the level of depolarization provided by the weak input does not produce an adequate reduction of the Mg 2+ block . When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .

But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not. A recent view is that a postsynaptic kinase is <head>activated</head> transiently ( for less than a few minutes following the tetanus ) and a presynaptic kinase is activated for longer periods ( but for less than 1 hour ) . These kinases might be the   and   isoforms of PKC ,  respectively .  Intracellular injection of the catalytic subunit of PKC induces synaptic potentiation as does the extracellular application of activators of PKC ,  such as certain phorbol esters .

This unsaturated fatty acid satisfies several of the requirements for a retrograde messenger :   ( 1 )  it is released from cultured neurons into the extracellular medium by the activation of NMDA receptors ,   ( 2 )  there is an increase in its efflux and postsynaptic availability following the induction of LTP ,   ( 3 )  inhibitors of phospholipase A 2  ,  an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid from phospholipids ,  block the induction of LTP r134135  ,  and  ( 4 )  the transient application of arachidonic acid to hippocampal synapses causes a slow - onset potentiation .  Potential targets for arachidonic acid include not only the presynaptic terminal ,  where it may act to increase L - glutamate release ,  but also glial cells where it depresses L - glutamate uptake and the postsynaptic cell ,  where ,  for example ,  it can potentiate NMDA receptor - mediated currents .  Another phospholipase A 2 - derived lipid , platelet - <head>activating</head> factor , also has some of the properties expected of a retrograde messenger . The possibility that nitric oxide  ( NO )  may be a retrograde messenger in LTP has excited considerable interest .  Like arachidonic acid ,  NO is released from cultured neurons exposed to NMDA .

The amplified Ca 2+  signal ,  in association with the other activators of protein kinases  ( zig - zag arrows )  ,  then leads to the phosphorylation of substrate proteins including ,  probably ,  AMPA and NMDA receptors .  Other enzymes , such as nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , if present , may also be <head>activated</head> by the Ca 2+ transient . Biochemical changes in the presynaptic terminal may be initiated by the action of retrograde messengers ,  such as arachidonic acid  ( AA )  ,  nitric oxide  ( NO )  and K +  ,  perhaps in conjunction with the action of L - glutamate on presynaptic mGluRs .

Walkinshaw HUMAN cyclophilin A  ( CypA )  ,  a ubiquitous intracellular protein of 165 amino acids ,  is the major receptor for the cyclic undecapeptide immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A  ( CsA )  ,  which prevents allograft rejection after transplant surgery and is efficacious in the field of autoimmune diseases .  CsA prevents T - cell proliferation by blocking the calcium - <head>activated</head> pathway leading to interleukin - 2 transcription . Besides their ability to bind CsA ,  the cyclophilin isoforms also have peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity and enhance the rate of protein folding .  The macrolide FK506 acts similarly to CsA and its cognate receptor FKBP also has peptidyl - prolyl isomerase activity .

In modern China an attempt has also been made to create a national art ,  in this instance by partly discrediting tradition .  In 1942 Lu Hsun was quoted by Mao Tse - tung as asserting that the aim of a modern Chinese artist should be :  By selection to accept the historical legacy of Chinese traditional art ;  to absorb the best style and technique from foreign art ;  and thus to establish a new national art in accordance with the demands and needs of the masses .  Mao <head>added</head> : To study the development of this old culture , to reject its feudal dross and assimilate its democratic essence , is a necessary condition of our new national culture . The critical distinction between feudal dross and democratic essence subsequently proved difficult to make .  This brief diversion into the cultural and political history of Germany ,  the USSR and China has been made to emphasise the way that a state may determine artistic production ,  and thence art criticism .

Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.

One can also <head>add</head> that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question . Seamus Mallon ,  MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,  but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view .

The rough insiders are on the walls ,  defending God 's  true believers from Romanism and immorality .

Despite Buckley 's  reluctance to play up the siege of Derry as a key myth and his preference for general categories of interpretation derived from various historical experiences ,  it does seem that the siege has particular significance .

On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .  It should be <head>added</head> here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type . Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,  they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .

The two Roman catholic priests ,  who were in all respects dedicated pastors and much liked by many in the local community ,  immediately opposed the idea ,  preaching against it at Sunday masses in the local convent and the school hall .

The curate <head>added</head> to this that those promoting the integrated project were in fact promoting secularism . The fact that a prominent member of the current community council and an integrated education supporter was a member of official Sinn Fein ,  the Workers '  party ,  appeared to figure in the reasoning ,  as this party has always been suspected to be an anti - clerical and secularist force .  In residents '  association meetings ,  the clergy 's  point of view received vocal support from one or two members of the older village community which preceded the housing estate .

Not unnaturally one consequence of this reductionism is that action and pragmatism take on an extra dimension in the police mind ,  holding a special place in the institutional imagination .

A heavy contact to the opponent 's  face may not merit just a verbal warning ;  after consultation with the other members of the panel ,  the referee can go directly to a full point penalty or even a disqualification .  In some cases the disqualification is not only from a particular event within a tournament ,  but from the whole tournament .  The second thing to note is that each offence carries its own scale of penalties , and penalties for one offence are not <head>added</head> on to penalties imposed for a different offence . Thus if I incur a verbal warning for stepping out of the area ,  I do n't then expect to receive a half - point penalty for a slight contravention of another rule.

Behind the indecision lay a youth torn in one direction by the family business ,  not least perhaps his father 's  shadow hanging over him ;  and the preferences of his mind and ever prolific imagination in the other. Accordingly , he read arts in his first year ; commerce ( which included accounting , commercial law , political science and a couple of doses of mathematics ) in his second ; arts ( though strangely retaining political science ) for his third and fourth years , to which was <head>added</head> zoology . The choices are both a reflection of his inner confusion ,  and a statement of his determination to let his curiosity run wherever it would  -  and that long before mixed courses were popular .  The results confirm that he could have done very much better ,  but his mind was partly elsewhere ,  ever active ,  ever engaged ,  ever busy .

It lay along the  lines of Layton 's  understanding of the poetic function  which exists somewhere between fact and imagination ,  as Eli Mandel said of him. Not pure fact ,  not meretricious research ,  which observes and tames the insightful - prophetic thrust ;  not mere imagination or mental excitement  but the fruitful intercourse between the two ,  in an artistic equilibrium .  Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work he has always said that he works one word at a time , and can spend months , even years , in <head>adding</head> finesse to it ; he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude , still more so pedantry . It is not clear where this comes from .  There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom :  a work of art must be a work of free spirit ,  untrammelled by rules and regulations ,  wherein absolute consistency  or conformity of any sort  is out of place .

It was this work ,  along with the subsequent brilliance of his public performances ,  that created his reputation as Canada 's  leading young poet :  His virtues are his own ,  and they are considerable at his best he expresses himself ,  sometimes whimsically ,  sometimes passionately ,  in speech which is beyond the capacity of mere formula to produce ,  commented Allan Donaldson at the time .  Mr Cohen knows how to turn a phrase ,  his poems at their best have a clean ,  uncluttered line ,  and he writes about something ,   said Milton Wilson .  Easily the most promising , judged Pacey , in 1961 ; and George Woodcock <head>added</head> that Leonard was one who could write lines which are no longer good imitation Yeats ; they are lines which only Yeats could have imitated . A fresh and exciting talent a brilliant beginning ,  commented the anonymous reviewer in the Queen 's  Quarterly  .  All of this he offered in a variety of poetic forms ,  from the traditional quatrain to the more controversial prose - poem Friends .

For such ,  God only frowns on the world ,  and stirs it to judgment ;  the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ;  it merely expires ,  as Leonard expressed it ,  ending its life in three flag - swept days.

It is also advisable to take a vitamin B supplement to aid in the digestion of the carbohydrate .  Once the carbohydrate has been consumed it is stored as glycogen in the muscles and stays there until it is required for energy .  This storage of glycogen in the muscles <head>adds</head> to the overall size of the muscles . Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .

In mainland Europe the spacing between tracks and reversible signalling enables engineers to work on one track in complete safety while traffic continues to pass on the other. Here the engineers have to carry out most of their work on Sundays when traffic is light ,  but this often entails diversions and extended journey times followed by temporary speed restrictions for a few further days at the beginning of each week .  To compensate for these temporary speed restrictions additional recovery time is <head>added</head> to daytime schedules . Following studies by Eastern Region 's  engineers ,  a new tracklaying strategy was introduced in 1987 whereby  with the use of a new machine called the Dynamic Track Stabiliser  tracks could be handed back by 06.00 on Monday morning at the full 125mph line speed ,  eliminating the need for a temporary speed restriction and associated recovery time allowance .  Removal of these recovery allowances made possible a general acceleration of East Coast 125mph services from May 1987 .

The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .

The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .

There is a major difference between real ale and keg beer .  Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by filtration , chilling and pasteurisation . The aim is to produce beers that are sterile ,  have a long shelf life and are highly profitable .  In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .

The sugars dissolve into the water and the sweet liquid ,  called wort ,  is pumped to a copper .  The flowers of the hop plant add bitterness to beer and the oils in the plant also guard against any infections during the brewing process .  As the wort is boiled in the copper with the hops many brewers also <head>add</head> sugars , such as glucose or cereal syrup , to encourage a strong fermentation . CAMRA would prefer beer to be brewed solely from barley malt but the use of sugar dates back to the 19th century and many renowned beers ,  such as Marston 's  Pedigree ,  have recipes that include 10 per cent or more brewing sugars .  When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , producing at the same time ripe fruity aromas that <head>add</head> to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

Unfortunately releasing these into the wort requires mutually  incompatable  conditions .  Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of <head>adding</head> copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour . While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer ,  problems may be encountered .  First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .

To loose them off together ,  scatter - gun fashion :  Stavrogin says I am making this statement ,  incidentally ,  to prove I am in full possession of my mental faculties and understand my position ;  I want to forgive myself ,  this is my chief aim ,  my whole aim ;  I want everyone to look at me ;  I fall back on this as my last resource ;  The thing about me then was I felt bored with life ,  sick and tired of it ;  I am seeking boundless suffering ;  I took it into my head to mutilate my life somehow  ( not necessarily the same thing as seeking suffering ,  any more than seeking suffering need entail accepting it )  .  Let us pause for a moment over I want everyone to look at me .  And I would also like to <head>add</head> yet another reason to the already formidable pile , which is that Stavrogin intends a challenge to society . Now the first is one of Dostoevsky 's  alterations to the galley proofs of At Tikhon 's  ,  and the  second is a variant recorded by his widow .  I draw attention to their provenance because commentators have focused on the family - magazine question ,  on the attempt ,  that is ,  to get the chapter past Katkov in some shape or form ,  and I think this is only half the story .

Very few readers will notice this discrepancy ,  but all are flicked and jabbed at and irritated  those circling insects  by contradiction ,  by undetermination followed by overdetermination of reasons ,  by the narrator 's  fuss over details which do n't matter ,  his youthful sententiousness about women  ( the depths of the female heart )  and other irrelevancies ,  his moralizing ,  his way of wantonly bleeding a robust narrative with However ,  that may only have seemed so ,  his I have already described when he has n't ,  his promises to explain later which are n't kept when the reader does n't want explanation anyhow ,  he wants the story .  Once and once only in six hundred and seventeen pages the narrator gives his readership a disconcerting ,  impertinent prod by addressing it directly as Gentlemen .  These things <head>add</head> up. They add up to a novel of leaking secrets and amputated thoughts ,  of wildly comic material sometimes dully ,  almost dutifully deployed ,  as if the humour had escaped the teller ;  of people missing each other in dialogue Perhaps he did n't go out of his mind at all .

The voltages in  (  C3 ,  C2 ,  and C1  )  ,  each charge CL  through two diodes in series ,  but the charging path through C4  has only one diode ,  D11  .

You can change the output voltage by <head>adding</head> or subtracting sections ; C1 , D1 , D3 , and D2 constitute one section , for example .

However ,  the weaker the magnetic field ,  the lower the frequency needed for a given ion mass .  The weaker the AC electric field ,  the longer it takes to build up the power of those ions ,  but the build - up is unavoidable if the particle mass ,  the magnetic field strength and the AC signal frequency satisfy the formula for resonance .  In a cyclotron the energy of the particles is deployed into an orderly spiral motion around the axis of the magnetic field and the pumping action of that weak pulsating electric field progressively <head>adds</head> to that energy and causes a pressure build - up at confining surfaces as the particles are driven in spirals of larger radius . A cyclotron is fine - tuned to a resonant frequency specific to one chosen ion type .

In America fashion can actually be enforced .

A year or so later I chanced to meet him and he acknowledged that this was just criticism ,  but that he had been obliged to insert these names so that his book would look like a truly up - to - date ,  intouch work of scholarship .

The contradiction has long been lived with in practice ,  and students become adept in faking responses .  Nevertheless ,  it points to a flaw in the aesthetic defence of literary education ,  and one which implicitly encourages culturalist claims to take it over .  I should <head>add</head> that my own understanding of literature is largely in aesthetic terms ; at least , of poetry ; where fiction and drama are concerned , aesthetic approaches can , at best , only be partial . The idea of aesthetic education ,  as formulated by Schiller ,  seems an entirely noble one ;  the difficulty is in accommodating it to contemporary pedagogy .

By JOHN PIENAAR ,  Political Correspondent PENNED - IN by steel barriers between a noisy crowd of gay liberationists and the lonely emissary of the oppressed African Dinkas ,  few of the street - corner causes besieging this week 's  conference seem as hopeless as the campaign for Labour to organise in Ulster .  About 15 mainly Protestant and professional Belfast - based activists have made the trip to Brighton this year , <head>adding</head> their voices to the clamour as the largely indifferent stream of Labour delegates pours from the conference centre at lunchtime . The speaking invitation to Gerry Adams ,  the Sinn Fein president and MP for West Belfast ,  and vague expectations that a Tory Party branch may be recognised in North Down ,  have provided little encouragement of a parallel shift by Labour .  It is an absolute bloody shame that the Labour Party wo n't take this thing seriously ,  David Morrison ,  45 ,  a systems analyst and secretary of the campaign of 200 - 300 members ,  said .

If we allow public spending to grow consistently faster than growth in output ,  then either public borrowing has to be increased or taxation ,  he said during a debate on the policy review report Economic Equality .  John Smith was right to tell the country that a Labour government will only spend what it can afford .  This commitment brings credibility to our social programmes and <head>adds</head> to Labour 's electability . Opening the debate ,  Mr Smith did not return to this theme but dwelt on the pathways out of poverty proposed in the review ,  notably the introduction of a statutory minimum wage and the restoration of a link between pensions and average earnings .  Initially the minimum wage would be 50 per cent of male median earnings .

The magazine calls for a retrial on the grounds of the new evidence of the alleged Mail on Sunday payment ,  the excessive amount of damages awarded ,  and misdirection of the jury by the judge on the amount of aggravated damages they could award .  After listening to Mr Lightman 's  allegations ,  Lord Donaldson said that if Mr Oliver 's  affidavit was to be believed then The Mail on Sunday had acted in a wholly hypocritical way .  On the amount of damages , Mr Lightman said the Court of Appeal had a special responsibility to bear in mind the dangerous precedent which could be set by such awards , and <head>added</head> that in this case the award was out of all proportion to the alleged libel . He added :  No real crime was alleged in the libel .  It was not in a national newspaper .

Portsmouth must take some of the blame for the stalemate for they came defensively formed and defensively minded ,  and content to rely on breakaways to snatch an equaliser and ,  faintly possibly ,  a winner .

According to this American guide ,  Art criticism is a many - levelled activity that comprises the historical ,  the recreative ,  and the judicial .

The signs are that the next few years will see some extensive soul - searching about art history ; several books have already <head>appeared</head> . From Germany there is The End of the History of Art  ;  from Britain a group of essays describe The New Art History  ;  from the United States has recently come Rethinking Art History :  meditations on a coy science  ;  and from Canada there is a forthright title Art History :  its use and abuse  .  Art criticism seems more likely to remain in the shadows ,  out of the spotlight of academic controversy .

Art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology ,  although the difficulties include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events .  Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .  This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight <head>appear</head> . Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about different aspects of the past ,  such as social conditions .  Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian .

The Story of Art  highlights change and development ,  sadly at the expense of art which is less varied ,  of however high a quality .  In other words ,  stylistic change is at a premium ;  in Gombrich 's  book the dramatic innovations of Caravaggio do well ,  but a distinguished painter ,  say Bonnard ,  who is not so bold or challenging an artist was omitted until additions were made to the text in 1971 .  As for a varied painter , only one work is likely to <head>appear</head> in a survey . The imperative for a writer of a chronological survey is that a defined period of time is covered ;  this may be linked with a theme ,  such as the history of styles in Gombrich 's  case ,  but it is unlikely to be linked solely with a spotlight on quality .  Excellence is not necessarily a criterion for including a picture or a sculpture in a chronological survey .

The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose difficulties for the critic ,  though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture .  In sum , then , the monograph is a major site for art critical writing , and , moreover , the place where the most extended criticism is likely to <head>appear</head> . The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .  In a monograph ,  the author has the best chance of a free hand .

It is also through observation that fakes are unmasked .

A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum ,  that is to say a show of recent work ,  through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition .  We have already looked at writing in catalogues ,  and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles .  The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it <head>appears</head> , as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's dismissal from the New York Times because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's readers . The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .

One aspect of illusion is perspective ,  much valued in the Western tradition .  Three sorts of perspective are identified by Leonardo da Vinci in his treatise on painting ,  as follows :  The first deals with the reasons of the ( apparent ) diminution of objects as they recede from the eye , and is known as Perspective of Diminution : the second contains the way colours vary as they recede from the eye : the third and last explains how objects should <head>appear</head> less distinct in proportion as they are more remote . And the names are as follows :  Linear perspective ,  the perspective of colour ,  the perspective of disappearance .  The Renaissance became enamoured of perspective ,  indeed Vasari thought that Paolo Uccello took it too seriously .

Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .  In a different sort of context , what <head>appears</head> to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagined figure . The totems of American Indians ,  the carvings of Inouk ,  ancient bronze ritual vessels from China ,  and many more examples can be found through the world and the centuries .  Most African sculpture is not in this category ,  as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance .

Most African sculpture is not in this category ,  as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance .  Care has to be taken by a critic in any of these cases to describe works as definitely as possible .  A totem , for example , can be described first as it <head>appears</head> , then as an object which has stylised figures in the sculpture . A further example of abstract form which is not mere pattern is Tantric art .  A Tantric painting or drawing has a spiritual purpose ,  to assist the user in meditation .

Hawksmoor  ,  which came out in 1985 ,  was preceded by the Eliot biography of 1984 ,  which was preceded by The Last Testament   of Oscar Wilde of the year before ,  and in 1987 these annual events were pressed upon by Chatterton  .  All four books reveal a steady concern with imitation and interpretation ,  and to read them together is to be clearer about what it is that the writer intends us to think that he thinks about things .  He would <head>appear</head> to believe in an invented truth , an invented reality a Rortyan reality , one might be inclined to call it at times . He believes that a writer will often find himself through exposure to some other writer .

The article leads you to wonder about her religious faith ,  if she has one ,  and about where it stands in relation to the outlook of the editor of Commentary  ,  author of a book about his ambitions for worldly success :  Making it  must be the least pious book that has ever been written .  The stress on Levi 's  insensitivity to religion is allowed to suggest that all Jews are religious ,  and there are readers for whom this might signal the corollary that all Jews are Zionists ,  and are likely to be supporters of Israeli government policy .  By these standards , Levi would <head>appear</head> to be an imperfect Jew , and this could well be an opinion that underlies the talk about his later books being not nearly as good as his earlier ones .

THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances ,  it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions .  Rather we are looking at those beliefs , supported by significant power bases within each bloc , which have won out in the political process in the past seventy years and still <head>appear</head> to be doing so , in some cases with much decreased vitality . The dominant beliefs of the catholic  nationalist bloc still are that the group forms a people who are Gaelic - Irish ,  constitute a nation ,  are republican ,  and populate an island which has a natural ,  inner political unity .  We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .

The prevailing protestant  loyalist beliefs stress the existence of the people of Northern Ireland ,  who are distinguished by their Ulster protestantism and democratic values ,  and by their claim to a flexible territory of Ulster .  Despite some socialist groups within the alliance ,  the dominant economic belief is capitalist .  A further central belief has recently begun to <head>appear</head> as equivocal , namely loyalism itself .

Indeed ,  until the ecumenical era of the 1960s ,  few catholics in Ireland were prepared to put before themselves some of the political religious issues which would have to be resolved if a united Ireland or accommodation to a separate political entity in Ulster were to become a possibility .  The other alliance in Ireland ,  the protestant  loyalist ,  does not thus far perceive itself as a nation .  The view that they are one <head>appears</head> mainly in the writings of the British and Irish Communist Organization ( 1972 ; 1973 ) . However ,  there can be little doubt that significant numbers of protestant loyalists see themselves as a distinct ,  almost ethnic group .  Clearly ,  they can be seen to have a particular self - concept ,  a sense of what Weber termed social honour  ( Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor 1986 )  .

From within this perspective bishops and clergy lay down rules for the laity to follow in any given situation and the teaching of the church is seen as absolutely clear and devoid of problematic .  Rules are enforced rather than principles declared .   In terms of the Irish catholic nationalist context today , pietism and authoritarianism have tended to structure the religion of the people to a significant extent , though the numbers subscribing to its world view <head>appear</head> to be declining . The clergy are seen as above criticism in their religious statements ,  and such criticism can cause considerable distress to many people .  In his analysis of the popular culture which appeared among the promoters of the Pro - Life Campaign ,  set up to achieve a constitutional ban on abortion in the Republic in 1983 ,  O'Carroll pin - points certain characteristics ,  which can be abbreviated here :  a monolithic and absolute view of the world ,  with its accompanying intolerance ,  derived in part from the direct consultation of clerics and politicians on public moral issues and the subsequent failure to develop an ethos of public debate ;  a localized belief system ,  rooted in family and communal authority and issuing in a spirit of absolute conformity ;  sexual prudery ,  a product partly of the inheritance problem ;  and the development of acute anxiety when such beliefs  inhering partly as they do in their practice and shaping of society  are threatened .

In fairness to de Valera ,  it must be said that he opposed any attempt to incorporate the church into the apparatus of the state and in this was ,  as already noted ,  going against the form of relationship preferred by the Popes of the day .  But his attitude was by now part of the common sense of clergy and people alike .  There <head>appeared</head> to be no reason to upset long - established routines in this respect . But that did not mean that the ethos of a Roman catholic state would be in any way diminished ,  only that the form of political religious power would be different .  An important aspect of the successful implementation of these parts of the constitution was that the political opposition did not object to them .

The change in the socio - moral context was hardly recognized ,  and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had remained unformulated .  In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,  it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts , it <head>appears</head> that the underlying reality to such difficulties was , and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic nationalist alliance has still failed to solve . On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened degree of institutionalized catholic  value in law.

The Roman catholic bishops supported the wording of the referendum and ,  as the referendum approached ,  said it was legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one was against abortion ,  which was in any case still immoral and was the direct taking of an innocent life  ( Irish Bishops '  Conference statement ,  quoted O'Carroll 1983 )  .  However ,  on the eve of the referendum ,  the majority of priests preached against abortion .  The nexus <head>appears</head> to have been made for a sufficient number of the laity , as those who eventually voted in the referendum voted in favour of inscribing an appropriate anti - abortion clause in the constitution . Article 40 ,  paragraph 3 ,  section 3 ,  now reads :  The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and ,  with due regard to the equal right of life of the mother ,  guarantees in its laws to respect ,  and ,  as far as practicable ,  by its laws ,  defend and vindicate that right .

As mentioned ,  it was already forbidden by law to procure an abortion .  Its constitutionalization is a direct result ,  not of this already widespread opinion ,  but of Roman catholic pressure of the monopoly type .

Divorce has this effect because it suggests that remarriage in the lifetime of one 's  first partner is socially and even morally acceptable '  (  Irish Times  ,  6 June 1986 ;  also 31 May 1986 ;  14 June 1986 )  .  This same interpretation <head>appeared</head> in the Irish bishops ' next statement in mid - June. Voters had to decide in conscience whether other factors outweigh the damage which divorce would certainly cause to individuals ,  to families ,  to children and to the whole of society  (  Irish Times  ,  13 June 1986 )  .  The bishops claimed ,  however ,  they were making it clear that people could in conscience vote for the introduction of divorce without incurring moral blame provided they made the decision in a reflective and conscientious way .

Colm said No. (  Irish Times  ,  17 May 1986 )  Protestant churches were not unaffected by the spirit in which the campaign often <head>appeared</head> to be conducted . Some members of the anti - abortion lobby had apparently been indicating the weak moral stance of protestants on the issue .

A notable achievement of ACT has been the passing of the Education  ( Northern Ireland )  Act of 1978 ,  permitting the establishment of multi - denominational schools where such is desired by adequate numbers of parents .  The Act is an enabling one and does not affect the existing system unless the leadership of the churches wish to co - operate in a reshaping of the system or of schools in any particular area .

The burden of the message was that good catholic parents sent their children to catholic schools .

The total of those favouring denominational schooling in the initial survey was less than one - third .

Because of the risk of a failure of the battery - operated Artificial Horizons ,  I always insist that pilots are competent to fly on the Turn and Slip Indicator before even trying a Horizon .

One or two short climbs in cloud do not prove the ability of a pilot to cope with the required longer periods of concentration and more varied conditions in larger clouds .  However ,  there are a number of risks to be considered by even the most competent pilot ,  and these are outside the pilot 's  control once the cloud climb has been started .

( He even ran a government - sponsored travelling company ,  serving mainly the peasants in outlying areas .  )  We shall see Leonard likewise being diverted from pure poetic concentration in order to achieve maximum hearing .  Another aspect may well be Lorca 's rejection of industrialisation a Romantic hangover , no doubt ! which <head>appears</head> in Leonard 's oscillation in his late teens between commerce and art . Yet another is Lorca 's  love of the city ,  a curious contradiction of his anti - industrialism ,  which only comes out explicitly in Leonard 's  devotion to Montreal ,  though he soon became snared by New York ,  London ,  Paris ,  Athens and Los Angeles ,  to name but a few of his favourite cities .  All this is of great significance for exploring Leonard 's  characteristics ,  for what was natural to Leonard 's  incipient viewpoint and versification now found stimulating and corroborative encouragement .

He had seen beyond the excitement of being approached for his first book ;  he already visualised it on the bookshelves !  Following the professor 's  agreement to the material ,  Leonard now set his own hand to the matter entirely ,  learning at 21 the art of negotiation with typesetters ,  printers ,  binders and designers .  ( There had been no plan to illustrate the book , but Leonard talked his friend and fellow - student Freda Guttman into it , and so the book <head>appeared</head> with five designs from her hand ) . Professor Dudek had envisaged the series coming out in paper covers  ( the format that was just becoming the  way  to the mass market )  ;  Leonard ensured that it went into hard ;  Dudek had not meant the books to be prestigious in format but vehicles of introduction ;  Leonard saw to it that his book could stand alongside the best that there were from both sides of the Atlantic .  And he himself covered the entire costs  ( of 300 )  ,  and did most of the distribution and selling  ( on the campus ,  in the local cafs ,  in bookstores and so on ,  aided by a mini - advertising campaign in the McGill paper )  .

The fact that we often feel that our thoughts come unheralded by intentions ,  that the content of our mental life is unwilled ,  just demonstrates how thin is the layer of consciousness .  This is a familiar point to those who know anything of Freudian theory .  But there is , perhaps , one crucial objection to the constructivist 's claim that moving the focus away from mental representations and towards mental actions will make the mind - body problem <head>appear</head> to us as less of a problem . It is this :  saying that the character of mental representations  ( beliefs and imaginings ,  for example )  can be understood only in terms of a history of activity ,  or that it is the subject 's  conception of himself as active in relation to the world which gives these representations their content or semantics  ( I hope to have shown something like this )  is simply irrelevant  to the mind - body problem .  This is the problem of how mentality  call it mental representations or cognisant acts  relates to its physical realization in the brain .

The only people who can change the situation are the players themselves .  They always have some excuse ,  but Russia has far worse facilities than we have and how many players have they got in the top fifty ;  three men and three women ?  One wonders how often our players play in tournaments for if one looks at the tennis results in the daily newspapers one seldom sees the letters G.B . behind the player 's name , and if we do , seldom does it <head>appear</head> past the first round . Perhaps the tennis circuit as we know it today does not suit the British temperament .  What about a feature on Where are they now with comments on why they did not continue on the circuit .

In the semi - finals Miss Lockhart ,  very much a hard hitting baseline player ,  went on to defeat No. 3 seed Lindsay Nimmo in a very close battle ,  while Nina Topper defeated Maggie Laughton 75 62 .  The ladies final ,  somewhat overshadowed by the men 's  final ,  was resumed in the evening because of rain .  The Edinburgh student <head>appeared</head> too consistent and resilient for Miss Topper who seemed to be struggling with the slippery court , and she triumphed 36 61 63 an impressive achievement for a No. 7 seed . Unfortunately ,  the ladies doubles final had to be cancelled ,  but the men 's  title was taken by Pashley and Carswell .  This tournament has filled an important gap in Higher Education tennis thanks to Midland Bank 's  financial support  ( which stretches from sponsoring schools tennis right through to the World circuit )  .

Perhaps the most important factors in choosing veneers are those of tone and colour ;  and of these ,  tone is the more over - riding .  For tone and colour are not synonymous ,  though the two terms are often wrongly interchanged .  Tone is the amount of light a surface reflects and so determines how light or dark that surface <head>appears</head> to the viewer . Colour refers to the actual wavelengths of the light rays concerned and determines the hue  ( redness ,  blueness ,  etc )  ,  which can be bright or dull ,  muted or full .  Most timber colours are of somewhat muted hues and generally very subtle  ( though not often dull )  ,  but can vary enormously from one another in tone value .

The temper of the tools seems good ,  just soft enough to give a razor - edge ,  but not too soft that they bend against hard grain .  So ,  no problem with temper .  Some carvers prefer the thicker bevels for mallet work , but as these tools lend themselves more to paring and slicing , the finer edges <head>appear</head> imperative . As for the curves in this selection ,  the C13 and C14 were not the same ,  and therefore the work that was possible with one tool could not be repeated on its mirror image with its counterpart .

The effects of movement can be observed in antique pieces from the 17th century onwards ,  where cleats were put across the ends of structures like writing desk falls in order to gain a flush surface .  Frequently ,  such furniture now displays longitudinal splits in the boards .  The earlier and well - known technique of framing up a loose panel <head>appears</head> to have been sacrificed to the whimsy of fashion . In more modern furniture where a composite board of inherent stability ,  such as plywood ,  has been used the use of end and side lippings of solid wood is both sage and justifiable in concealing raw edges .  But ,  where as you suggest ,  custom designed pieces which adopt this practice when using sold wood there is the likelihood of failure whatever the species or moisture content .

Age Concern welcomes the Government 's  proposals to remove administrative barriers to people who wish to change general practitioners .

However ,  there is nothing in the White Paper to act as a positive incentive for such work ,  and Age Concern is worried by the proposal in Working Paper 3 that once allocations are made to practices holding their own budgets ,  they will be free to shift expenditure within the year between the individual components of the budget .  The granting of a higher capitation allowance for elderly people will not necessarily mean that this money is spent on services for elderly people .

This is what must happen when a ballet ends happily .  Three fine examples of this exhilaration can be found in the excited circling of the cast round the hero and heroine in such ballets as Copplia ,  Pineapple Poll  and Daphnis and Chlo  .  Choreographers however should avoid what can be called a purely technical analysis of the music by matching particular patterns of steps to particular musical phrases whenever they <head>appear</head> . This is what Balanchine has frequently done .  It was first noted in Ballet Imperial   ( 1941 )  when every time a scale - like passage in the second movement of Tchaikovsky 's  Piano Concerto No. 2 is played ,  the three soloists link hands to make two arches through which the corps de ballet  ran round the houses  ( Edwin Evans )  .

Once the basic structure fur a story ballet has been created ,  the choreographer must find ways of linking the beginning ,  climax and end so that the plot develops easily from one scene to the next .  This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first performance of Giselle , certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters <head>appear</head> . These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and audience to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players .  Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .

But it is not so easy to find good examples of his suggestion that batterie  can lend wit except in the Blue Boy 's  rvoltades  in Ashton 's  Les Patineurs  .

Today 's  dancers not only dance fur an audience .  They also dance for and with each other. And it is their response to each other 's movements and their own enjoyment in dance that makes their behaviour <head>appear</head> natural and spontaneous even when they perform difficult technical feats . It is perhaps not surprising that choreographers use the classical style fur most abstract ballets .

It should be noted that a similar order of precedence exists in Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  as in Petipa 's  The Sleeping Beauty  which was supposed to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of Louis XIV .  However ,  when ballets were performed for the public ,  professional dancers took the place of courtiers and technical innovations had to be made .  The dancers now <head>appeared</head> on a stage before a wide audience and the focus of their attention changed to the whole audience or to the most important performers . They had to adapt their movements to cover a larger space which was like a box with one side only being open to public gaze .  They had to pay greater attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .

These rules still hold good for choreographers who work in the classical medium and the wise ones never neglect them .  If they do ,  their design loses the calm spaciousness which the style demands ,  no matter how fast or slow the dance .  for example : by making his six dancers <head>appear</head> equally important in Symphonic Variations Ashton was the first to break away from the convention of making a ballerina the focus of attention . ( He repeated this idea for the six dancers in Monotones I and II  .  )  Nevertheless his choreographic plan is so designed that each movement of every dancer ,  whether as an individual or part of the group ,  is co - ordinated with the others so that it fits correctly into the overall pattern and within the space allotted by stage ,     wings and backcloth which  in Symphonic Variations   delicately echoes the curving lines or the dance .

He further developed what he called his danced mime or mimed dance in The Firebird  and above all in Petrushka  .  It is in this field that Ashton and MacMillan have made many innovations in those of their ballets that describe very subtle relationships ,  feelings and emotions such as A Month in the Country  and Enigma Variations ,  The  Invitation  and Mayerling  .  In the last , MacMillan 's choreography makes Bratfisch , the prince 's coachman , <head>appear</head> as the only sympathetic yet helpless onlooker at the sordid proceedings . Bratfisch attempts to entertain the doomed couple at the last meeting before their death and his sorrow as he comes to the graveside of the murdered .  heroine are an object lesson in understatement .

However despite the great variety of demi - caractre ballets staged since 1789 there <head>appear</head> to be only three main sources of gesture which contribute to a particular style for a particular ballet . These have led to the same stereotyping of characters as happens in classical ballet .  The three sources are :

Ashton did the same when Daphnis competed for Chlo 's  attention in his interpretation of Ravel 's  Daphnis and Chlo  .  When the character of Harlequin ,  the Comic Lover ,  had become familiar in England he was quickly promoted to lead the pantomimes ;  nowhere in ballet does he rise to more commanding heights than as Captain Belaye in Cranko ,  s Pineapple Poll  ,  where he takes on the superior airs and manners of the British Navy and becomes the apple of every girl 's  eye .  Columbine too started life as a servant of the gods and gradually rose in rank from waiting on the aristocracy to conspiring with Harlequin in such ballets as The Good - Humoured Ladies , where the two of them <head>appear</head> as serving maid and waiter . Columbine became Mother Simone 's  daughter ,  Lise ,  in La Fille Mal Garde  where she makes butter ,  churns and helps to spin .  She is also there as the inquisitive fun - loving Swanhilda in Copplia  and displays a humble origin in Cranko 's  Pineapple Poll  .

The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high ,  back slightly arched ,  arms in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes  for Kitri or on demi - pointes  for Basil .  The brilliant bravura variation when Kitri springs lightly forwards sur les pointes whilst fanning herself and Basil attempts to make his zapateado ( heel - tapping ) <head>appear</head> authentic by the slightly crouching pose of his body , add even greater panache to their efforts . Swanhilda strikes similar poses with her mantilla and fan in Copplia  and so do the Spanish dancers in Swan Lake  .  However Massine in The Three - Cornered  Hat  took an entirely different view .

Ashton 's  re - working of the old story of Ondine   ( with music by Hans Werner Henze )  was a perfect modern version of the older type of romantic ballet .  He not only used very expressive ports de bras  for his other - worldly characters but changed the usual conception of classical pointe - work .  Ondine , the sea nymph ( Margot Fonteyn ) so used her feet that she <head>appeared</head> always to float through water . This was done by a series of pas marchs  each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel .  They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the arms .

Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his arms .  It shows her growing emotional involvement and gradually seems to affect her every movement .  This same tiny movement also <head>appears</head> when Vera begins to dance with the Tutor , but her movement is not so intense . It does not develop into the passionate circling en l air  that occurs when the Tutor swings Natalia round as she rests on his knee before they ultimately turn to face each other and embrace .  This particularly subtle quiver of the leg to express newly aroused emotion was first noticed in Ashton 's  The Two Pigeons  when the Young Girl and her friends pretend to strut around like pigeons .

Success will depend very largely on the dancer 's  own sense of timing and ability so to perform the gestures created that they convey meaning which makes sense within the context of the ballet .  This can be done only if the whole body is seen to be involved in some way or other. It also depends on how the gesture is extended in time and space so that it <head>appears</head> to emanate from the dancer 's concentration on the purpose of the gesture . Amongst the greatest dancer - mimes even the slightest wink  becomes obvious .  De Valois ,  Ashton and MacMillan have studied paintings and drawings by English artists and/or the words of such great playwrights as Shakespeare and translated them into gestures for which the dancer 's  whole body has to play a part .

It successfully conveys something of this many faceted tale of daring behaviour .  To produce any kind of character and/or national ballet the choreographer should call on the three kinds of mime mentioned earlier ,  viz. conventional and occupational gesture and natural emotional expression .  Conventional gestures are valuable not only because they often <head>appear</head> in the epics themselves , but also because they are universally recognised as a means of communication in real life and have been used on the stage since the earliest days of the theatre . They must be performed and co - ordinated with the dance style and musical rhythms appropriate to the location where the story is being enacted .  They must also be performed and co - ordinated with the occupational gestures that belong to the location and that are employed by the particular inhabitants whose story ,  with its moods ,  emotions and actions ,  is being told .

These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's  particular behaviour and reactions .  Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock ,  unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's  Progress  and A Distant Drummer  .  In each of the three ballets discussed movements are not merely coloured by natural emotional expression but often by conventional and occupational gesture , which <head>appear</head> to spring from each dancer 's physical and mental reactions to each situation as it arises . A comparison of such different ballets as Enigma Variations ,  Fancy Free  and The  Rake 's  Progress  emphasises how important it is for young choreographers to remember that ballet is an art of the general as well as of the particular .  This arises from the fact that no one really dances through life ,  though doing so once the curtain has risen .

Many smaller brewers do not have the capital to invest in lager production lines and buy their lagers from the nationals ,  including Guinness 's  Harp subsidiary .

The MMC 's  radical proposals included a demand that the nationals should collectively sell off 22,000 pubs ,  loan ties should be banned and all tenants should be free to buy beers free of the tie .

And he caught his hero too since a man is  ( among a million other things  but art concentrates attention )  the yellows he sees and tastes ,  and the evil rancid oil he smells .  Also ,  and perhaps to a greater extent ,  a man is what he has  smelt :  later in the novel Raskolnikov gives the police - station smell as the reason for the suspicious circumstance of his fainting ,  which is neither the whole truth nor a straight lie but the blending of the guilty man with the Poison of the city .  Crime and Punishment 's Petersburg does not produce the murderer with the inevitability shown by the abstract city in the novel immediately preceding it , where the underground man was bound to <head>appear</head> in our midst . The draft letter to Katkov merely claims that crimes like this fictional one can be found in the newspapers ,  and that the fictional murderer has come under the influence of certain half - baked ideas which happen to be in the air at the time .  Here ,  despite life following art with Danilov 's  double murder ,  we have an ordinary modest contingent naturalism ,  and in this area the novel bears out the letter to Katkov .

I wo n't allow myself to be tortured ,  Raskolnikov tells Porfiry ,  but our sense of their three long encounters is that there 's  nothing either of them can do about it .  In a single serpentine sentence Porfiry seems to dissolve into his own prose ,  showering Raskolnikov with a patter of tiny verbal blows as if exercising the Russian particle for its own sake  (  nu da uzh )   ,  telling him that he considers him quite incapable of committing suicide ,  and in the same breath to leave a short circumstantial note if he does .  This , in the blood and bone of the novel , is how the doubleness the two levels <head>appears</head> , in which all is destined and anything can happen . It might be objected that the doubleness is just a trick of Porfiry 's  .  But this would n't match up to the greatness of the Porfiry - Raskolnikov scenes .

For Raskolnikov is incorrigibly patrician and rare at heart  ( which is one reason why the Epilogue does not convince )  ,  even if I have overstressed the Hamletish side to him. Nevertheless his crime ,  like the tawdry footloose elimination of Shatov ,  springs from unsteadiness  (  shatost )   .  The word <head>appears</head> twice in Dostoevsky 's letter to Katkov outlining Crime and Punishment , in the phrase unsteadiness of ideas which is natural since a drama of reflection is about to unfold : thinking is Raskolnikov 's work , as he tells the maid Nastasya .

Furthermore ,  At Tikhon 's  provides the chance to get a look at the figure named by me Dostoevsky 's  good angel ,  because here again ,  as in the two earlier cases ,  the novelist took no steps to restore the deleted material at some future date when he was his own master ;  and I think he was right .  My Proposition ,  embracing The House of the Dead ,  Notes from Underground ,  Crime and Punishment ,  The Possessed ,  Karamazov  ,  and ,  negatively ,  by way of relative failure ,  The Idiot  ,  is that Dostoevsky could only promote his dearest values by creeping up on their blind side :  in other words that he had an urge towards crisis and clarity which he could only satisfy by yielding it to the enemy  to the horror of the flogging routine in the Thy kingdom come episode in the Dead House at one chronological extreme ,  and to Ivan Karamazov 's  showdown with the Religion Swindle at the other. Clarity <head>appears</head> in those self - directed exhortations of the novelist to elucidate Raskolnikov 's motive for murder . The novel itself ignores them .  Crisis introduces the word podvig  ,  translated exploit or feat ,  though Jacques Catteau remarks that avancement  sometimes renders it best .

This incident of the bitten car ,  presented explicitly as a challenge to society ,  has no tonal affinity whatever with Raskolnikov 's  murder ,  its home is with the underground man sticking his tongue out ;  the hesitant backward movement towards the world under the floor is also a forward fumble towards Stavrogin and The Possessed  .  And what of the document itself ?  Since At Tikhon 's is constantly referred to in Russia and the West as Stavrogin 's Confession , it occurs to me to note that the word confession does not <head>appear</head> anywhere in the chapter . That the written statement and its publication add up to a true Dostoevsky confession ,  to repentance and acceptance of suffering ,  to a wonderful podvig  in Tikhon 's  words ,  is one possibility among many .  Stavrogin s prodigal scattering of reasons does more than leave the question open .

Therefore ,  extra headroom has to be provided for the operating flux .

DA Ellis Shipston - on - Stour Warwickshire  Light hearted With regard to the debate about c and Doppler shifts in the letters pages , light ( velocity c ) reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v towards an observer <head>appears</head> to be blue shifted , or red shifted in the case of a receding surface . As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the difference in photon energy  (  E '  E = hf '  hf  )  of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity  (  v  )  acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon .  The extra energy not being allowed to be expressed as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f ,  that is :   ( formula included )  where m is the photon equivalent mass  ( yes I know it is related to E  but I am trying not to confuse myself )  ,  E  is the energy ,  and h  is Mr Plank 's  claim to fame .

It is arguable that the disappearance of grammar schools was a further factor in the weakening of the English synthesis ,  in addition to those I have discussed .  At all events ,  when the innovative literary theory derived from structuralism began to arrive about twenty years ago it found actual or potential fissures in the form of life and it sought to enlarge and penetrate them .  An adversarial stance <head>appeared</head> in literary study . It is evident in a curious book ,  edited by Stephen Heath ,  Colin MacCabe ,  and Christopher Prendergast and published in Cambridge in the early 1970s :  Signs of the Times :  Introductory Readings in Textual Semiotics  .  It was a collection of essays designed to introduce la nouvelle critique  to ignorant English readers :  apart from the editors ,  the contributors included Julia Kristeva and Philippe Sollers ,  and there was an interview with Roland Barthes .

David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .  In 1977 he published The Modes of Modern Writing  ,  an illuminating and original application of Roman Jakobson 's  distinction between metaphor and metonymy to the criticism and history of twentieth - century literature .  My main reservation about the book , which is more evident to me now than when it first <head>appeared</head> , is that Lodge has too direct and univocal an understanding of the elusive concept of literature . His book showed that new ideas were in the air ,  and senior academics began to drop passing references to Barthes or Derrida ,  not always accurately .  Others ,  more inward with la nouvelle critique  ,  adopted a polemical rhetoric .

It was from the beginning very successful ,  which I take to be evidence of the growing sense that the established English synthesis was weakening ,  with a corresponding desire among students and teachers for new orientations .  The series did not have a uniform intellectual line and many varieties of opinion could be found in the contributors .  But it <head>appeared</head> at precisely the right moment to catch the poststructuralist tide associated with Derrida and the later Barthes , and several of the most influential titles brought together , rather uneasily , poststructuralism and Marxism . This is true of Belsey 's  book ,  of Hawkes 's  own Structuralism and Semiotics  ,  of Tony Bennett 's  Marxism and Formalism  ,  of many of the contributions in Peter Widdowson 's  Re - Reading English  ,  and of Anthony Easthope 's  Poetry as Discourse  .  These texts share a fighting tone and a conviction that established forms of literary study ,  and in some cases even the concept of literature itself ,  have to be overthrown .

Or this :  At this point ideology makes a forceful intervention the voice of ideology is frequently heard ideology never stops talking .

Terence Hawkes 's Structuralism and Semiotics <head>appeared</head> in 1977 as a timely primer on la nouvelle critique and it presents much information in a readable form . It is ,  however ,  written in a crusading spirit ,  without any critical distance ,  and it is informed ,  like Belsey 's  book ,  by the assumption that language  or literature  can give us no certain knowledge of the world .  Hawkes 's  polemical purpose becomes more and more apparent as the book develops :  it is to undermine ,  not only established literary study ,  but liberal humanism itself .

Beyond this specific instance , fourfoldness has a life of its own in his thought ; it <head>appears</head> in card - games le jeu des cartes relates to le jeu Descartes , where there are four suits , plus a joker , whom Megill identifies with Derrida himself .

Or ,  the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication ,  such as photography ,  film or television .  there is every reason to welcome such studies ,  though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's  greater stress on interpretation .

For example ,  the writing of Rosalind Krauss has mainly been published in two journals ,  the American October  and the French Macuba  ,  both advancing a special interpretation of twentieth - century art .  This stance is partly a reaction against what Krauss saw as a dominant position in American criticism ,  by which the art of the last hundred and thirty years ,  the art of modernism ,  is not being well served by writing that promotes the myths through which it can be consistently misread .

Doubtless some protestant paramilitaries  though there have been fewer religious persons among them than in the case of the provisionals  hold to similar religious understandings of the necessity of violence under certain circumstances .  Covenant theology itself empowers the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstances ,  and Ian Paisley and many of his supporters both within and without the Orange order have frequently used bully - boy tactics ,  and approved paramilitary processions ,  marching ,  and drilling .  From Carson to Paisley one finds the <head>argument</head> that it is legitimate to fight to regain one 's fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has covenanted one 's allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery . The argument is clearly inspired by a religious motivation and shows Ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion ,  approving whatever defensive measures are necessary to avoid submission to Rome rule. Ulster protestantism is not contained within churches but spills out on to the streets .

Despite what brewers '  architects often allege ,  the life expectancy of such plastic window units is proving remarkably short  as little as five years for the fittings ,  and twenty years for the plastic itself ,  which is exhibiting distinct tendencies to warp and discolour with age .

Most fieldwork is simply episodic ,  made by an outsider moving in for a period to assess observed social behaviour .  In this case ,  however ,  I have been unable to make the separation and the  fieldwork is both empirical and continuous ;  it is diachronic and retrospective ,  taking in the historical with the contemporary .  And as Mary Douglas ( 1973 : 15 ) had pointed out , if we cannot bring the <head>argument</head> back from tribal ethnography to ourselves , then there is little point in starting it at all . Like Douglas ,  I see no point in setting up a false theoretical dichotomy between us ,  and them ,  creating separate realms and polarities of modern and archaic thought ,  for I anticipate my inclusion of the concept of self can help link the tribalism which haunts the police defensiveness to an understanding of their modern beliefs ,  modes of thought ,  and action .  Hopefully this will allow the ethnography to extend on the interpretive analysis which Kuper  ( 1973 )  termed neostructural and which has since combined aspects of a feminist ,  semantic ,  and symbolic framework to generate what may well be a short - lived disciplinary ism of post - modern anthropology  ( Young 1989 )  .

So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general ,  however ,  reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular .  That <head>argument</head> showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .  It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .

The situation would be different from this only if the internal discriminations carried with them some experiential feel that was not to be identified with some physical process of which BS could know .  But this is just what the physicalist cannot allow .  The second and more important point is that the general <head>argument</head> against behaviouristic theories does take in functionalism and is not merely directed against traditional behaviourism : it works against any theory that analyses one 's conception of the world simply in terms of the way one functions that is , behaves in the world . The addition of internal discriminations within the nervous system adds nothing relevant to this ,  unless the internal discriminations really possessed semantic properties ,  so that they somehow contained in themselves a real description of the world .  But it is accepted by physicalists of all kinds that the meaning  or semantic value  of internal states must be analysed in terms of their causal relations to stimulus and response ,  just as it is for the behaviourist 's  dispositions ,  and is not something they possess in their own right ,  or of themselves .

This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .  So the flight from consciousness is the flight from any grasp on the intrinsic nature of any properties  not merely ,  as with Russell ,  of properties in the external world ,  but also of the features in our experience .  This is not merely a very bare conception of the world , but <head>argument</head> supports intuition in pronouncing it an incoherent one . It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .  All we know about As ,  for example ,  is that they have relation to R to Bs ,  relation R ' to Cs ,  relation R '  to Ds ,  etc ;  and similarly for our understanding of Bs ,  Cs and Ds ,  and the variety of Rs .

At the first ,  input - process level ,  we do not encounter philosophical problems in the classic sense :  these are problems of mental engineering ,  of cognitive science  in the current jargon .

It hardly needs saying that how this story is told will depend upon philosophical <head>argument</head> . But surely ,  you may say ,  consciousness does  consist of determinate mental episodes .

If functionalism is false ,  then the success of the cognitive sciences is a massive scientific fluke .  My <head>argument</head> for functionalism is therefore critically dependent on whether or not I can convince you that progress in one of these areas cognitive neuropsychology is unlikely to be simply an illusion .

Where a customer did not wish to purchase his own fleet of wagons ,  he was usually encouraged to hire or lease from firms such as Procor or Tiphook in preference to using railway - owned vehicles .  In the Construction sub - sector ,  for example ,  the use of railway - owned vehicles on aggregates traffic ceased altogether in 1989 ,  following the withdrawal of a pool of 16.5 tonne opens based in the Peak District .

And so ,  as in Winter Notes  ,  Dostoevsky is really talking about pochvennost  ,  his own brand of romantic conservatism ,  half history ,  half dream .  In Crime and Punishment  itself the Petrine reforms get the merest glancing reference ,  and only one ,  when Raskolnikov 's  friend Razumikhin speaks of us  ( compare the we of the Drunks  fragment )  as divorced from practical affairs of every sort for nearly two hundred years .  This is a hasty throw - off in the middle of a wide - ranging <head>argument</head> , and it has no particular bearing on drink . Nor for that matter on crime .

He had wanted to be a Napoleon and special .

The hyperconscious Double Act in which Svidrigailov 's  terminal boredom plays opposite the greedy ,  theoretical self - assertion of Raskolnikov 's  wanting something more than mere existence ,  becomes grounded in suicide and murder ;  and the Petersburg where these things happen gains a fuzzy - edged documentary aspect which never comes anywhere near dominating the novel ,  but which is there .

He recognizes the mythology of its English adherents ,  in which all criticism of their ideas attracts the charge of a characteristically insular suspicion of nasty foreign ideas ,  but he is prepared to risk it ,  continuing :  Those who feel hostile to much recent literary theory but are unwilling or unable to formulate their objections often lazily dismiss it as merely another Parisian fashion ,  citing the rapid displacement or structuralism by poststructuralism as evidence that the writings or Barthes ,  Derrida ,  Lacan and their American epigones constitute a craze rather than a serious intellectual movement .  There may be some justification for the ( insular ) suspicion that when the Emperor is restocking his wardrobe he usually shops in Paris ; but the rashionability or ideas does not or itself constitute an honest <head>argument</head> against them ; indeed , to offer this as one 's main response is to betray intellectual bankruptcy . It is less easy ,  but more interesting ,  to try to understand why  ancient radical doubts about the ability or language to express a genuine extra - linguistic reality have been revived in recent decades to the point where they seem to have achieved an almost popular appeal .  Tallis sets himself the task of showing that much of the structuralist and poststructuralist enterprise is based on a misreading of Saussure .

For deconstruction ,  however ,  this erasure of the world is crucial .  Scholes 's  case is the more telling in that he is far from being a conservative opponent of all recent developments in theory ;  he has written favourably of structuralism ,  and unsympathetically about fictional realism  ( for which ,  indeed ,  he has been attacked by Tallis )  ,  and elsewhere in Textual Power  he finds deconstructive reading  as opposed to the theory underlying it  a useful critical method .  The <head>arguments</head> of Tallis and Scholes against a major aspect of poststructuralist theory and practice should be attended to on the level at which they are advanced . But one rather doubts if they will be .  Those who are addicted to the vertiginous rhetoric where language tells us nothing about reality ,  merely about other language ,  and where signifiers float in endless unattached free play ,  are apt to be contemptuous of demonstration and logic ,  seeing them as forms of bourgeois intellectual oppression .

In Bowie 's  words ,  Future sociologists of knowledge will no doubt study the mechanisms whereby an enfeebled Lacanism ' has come to loom larger within the intellectual life of a society than the original  ideas and texts .  In England ,  Lacanian ideas have been linked with Marxist ones ,  as in MacCabe 's  James Joyce and the Revolution of the Word  ;  Catherine Belsey 's  Critical Practice  ,  which identified Lacan 's  symbolic order of language ,  into which the infant enters ,  with the Althusserian realm of ideology ;  and Anthony Easthope 's  Poetry as Discourse  which related Lacan 's  dissolution of the ego to New Critical impersonality and structuralist dropping of the author .  One would have thought that Marxism and Lacanism would inhabit wholly disparate worlds of thought ; the former is rationalistic and teleological , whereas for Lacan , as Bowie says , <head>arguments</head> directed towards a terminus are falsehoods . Yet there are affinities ,  as Frederick Crews points out :  In Althusser 's  and Lacan 's  hands ,  then ,  both Marxism and psychoanalysis exchange an adaptive materialism for allegory .

Leavisism assumed that its rewriting of the canon had a once - and - for - all quality ,  so that it was inconceivable that anyone could come to admire Shelley again ,  though this is precisely what has happened under the influence of Harold Bloom ,  who is dedicated to overturning the Eliot - Leavis version of poetic history .  The attempt to enforce an evaluative criticism in the academy inevitably results in rigidity and dogmatism and ,  ultimately ,  a form of brainwashing .  Leavisites , of course , claimed that they were committed to discussion , argument , the free play of mind ; in so far as they were , it was contained within the enclosing form of life , not directed against it , rather like <head>arguments</head> within Marxist - Leninist ideology . It was this aspect of Leavisism that Oxford English ,  with its broad though often flaccid eclecticism ,  was most opposed to .

At the same time ,  it was accepted that all the talks ,  petitions ,  donations and arguments had been brought about by the imminence of the Commonwealth Conference ,  where the Secretary - General ,  Sonny Ramphal ,  has warned that Britain may find itself in a minority of one over South Africa .  Mrs Thatcher has made it clear that Britain remains as adamantly opposed as ever to sanctions and has no intention of joining in new measures against South Africa .  The latest <head>argument</head> deployed in Whitehall yesterday was not only that sanctions hurt the worst - off sections of the South African community the ones they are designed to help but that financial measures against South Africa might induce the country to default on its international commitments . Mrs Thatcher has emphasised that to avoid the troubles which have afflicted other African countries ,  a majority - ruled South Africa must be based on a sound economy .  The British line has been that there is a huge difference between the image of Britain accepted in South Africa and the reality .

THE MAGAZINE Private Eye will have to wait two to three weeks to find out whether it has won a retrial on libel damages of 600,000 awarded against it to Sonia Sutcliffe ,  wife of the Yorkshire Ripper .  Lord Donaldson ,  Master of the Rolls ,  sitting with Lord Justices Nourse and Russell ,  yesterday reserved their judgment after Private Eye had rejected an offer from Mrs Sutcliffe to allow the Court of Appeal to set the amount of damages .  In his final <head>arguments</head> in the three - day hearing , Gavin Lightman QC , for the magazine , said that if a retrial was ordered it intended to subpeona the editor of the Mail on Sunday , Stewart Steven , and two senior journalists from the company in an effort to discover the truth behind a 25,000 payment to Mrs Sutcliffe . Mr Lightman claimed that if the jury which had awarded the 600,000 had known that Mrs Sutcliffe was not adverse to taking money for her story ,  the outcome could have been different .  He said evidence of private conversations between journalists of Associated Newspapers about the secret deal ,  and of Mrs Sutcliffe 's  deliberate concealment of The Mail on Sunday 's  actions ,  could throw completely new light on the case .

The southern African states have the right of the <head>argument</head> for two reasons , both severely practical . First ,  it would be as unrealistic to impose a world - wide ban on ivory as it would be to attempt to outlaw ,  say ,  tobacco or alcohol .

From Mr NICHOLAS BAKER ,  MP Sir :  In her article  ( 'The child as a piece of disposable property '  2 October )  ,  Sue Wells argues for a change in adoption law so as to bring it nearer an open adoption system ,  whereby adopted children remain in contact with birth parents .  This <head>argument</head> , based apparently upon the particular circumstances of a young woman in New Zealand whose daughter was unfortunate enough to grow up in care , itself an unusual experience , is dangerous and partial stuff .

Other trends in the economy ,  investment for example ,  are encouraging ,  and productivity has been rapid by British standards .  The cultural changes of the Thatcher years  supply - side improvements in management ,  shopfloor relations and the spirit of acquisitiveness  have resulted in a strong underlying improvement in Britain 's  economic performance ,  which the world recognises if the Labour Party does not. I rehearse these <head>arguments</head> not in an attempt to settle them but for the purpose of casting doubt upon the thesis that the performance of the economy is at the crux of the Government 's difficulties . If Mr Lawson now drives the economy into deep recession or ,  alternatively ,  inflation is let rip ,  the Government would almost certainly perish at the polls .  But its predicament is not yet as lurid as that .

Their action effectively scuppered six years of negotiations ,  since all decisions taken by the 22 signatories to the 1959 Washington Treaty  the framework for the political and environmental protection of Antarctica  -  must be unanimous .

Mr Laws contended that paragraph 16 ( 2 )  did limit the doctor 's  right to provide treatment by another deputy ;  that it was legitimate for the FPC to take into account the doctor 's  reasonable needs for time off duty for relaxation and rest ,  the advantages of continuity of patient care and the paragraph 16 obligation to give personal treatment .

In fact the Central Statistical Office 's  view is that the published deficit overstates the real level by no more than 2bn or 3bn .

Of all the <head>arguments</head> the Chancellor deploys , the most powerful is the contention that the deficit does not matter because it does not represent borrowing by the public sector in effect the deficit is all in the private sector .

Improvements in the handling of appeals The year had seen two separate and different initiatives .  The first was announced in a Practice Direction  ( 1989 )  1 WLR 281 ,  which provided for the much earlier delivery of skeleton arguments which would be studied by the judges before they sat to hear the appeal .  The primary purpose was to reduce the costly time spent on oral <head>argument</head> in so far as that was not necessary for the proper determination fo the appeal . It was too early to reach firm conclusions as to the direction 's  effectiveness .  The need to monitor that experiment and the conviction that the court would benefit from improved lines of communication between it and those who used the court ,  either as practitioners or as litigants ,  had led to the establishment of a Court of Appeal Users '  Committee ,  representative of both ,  which would have its first meeting later this month .

Routine policing in Easton is the responsibility of the uniform branch ,  which is divided between organizational units known as sections and the neighbourhood and community relations teams ,  as well as the plain - clothes units like the CID and CDU  ( Crime Detection Unit )  .

Easton station operates four sections  ( what in other police forces is called a relief )  ,  each working in turn one of three shifts ,  with the fourth week off .

Nothing much can be done about missing pets ,  but the impression of diligence and earnestness they leave with the bereft alone is a comfort .  In the occupational culture of Easton station most of these incidents are rendered afterwards into humorous stories ,  retold to new recruits and outsiders to demonstrate the funny side of policing ;  and the familiar RUC term all is regular ,  used to signify that a call has been attended to ,  has obvious humorous connotations for one of the community welfare tasks described here .  Another type is problem - solving calls , such as helping owners with injured dogs ( provoking enough interest for subsequent enquiries to be made about the dog 's progress ) ; giving impromptu lessons on road safety to young children who have narrowly avoided accidents ; and dealing with <head>arguments</head> between neighbours ( usually over noise ) and family disputes . Often the section police mop up the after - effects of problems ,  such as attending calls to fires ,  suicides ,  natural deaths ,  domestic disputes ,  and road traffic accidents .  The police on the British mainland do not attend many of these incidents unless a crime has been committed ,  but the RUC do so in order ,  as one said in relation to domestic disputes ,  to prevent crime .

But their ordinariness as policemen and women is indisputable .  The previous <head>arguments</head> have pointed to two ways in which policing in Easton is ordinary . Police duties in Easton are similar to those in non - divided societies ,  and the manner in which these tasks are viewed and accomplished parallels that elsewhere .  The routineness of police work in Easton is thus reinforced by the interpretative processes and practical reasoning that Easton 's  police share with policemen and women in other societies when doing routine police work .

The partial recovery of the economy after 1983 was to show that some of it was misplaced ,  and that fears about national ungovernability and inability to adapt were ill - founded .

The arts continued to flourish , amidst growing <head>argument</head> over the role of the Arts Council , the right balance to be struck between the metropolitan and the regional , and between private and public funding . British higher education remained another source of national pride and complacency ,  with the high international standing of British universities and polytechnics generally assumed ,  even though the  differential fees imposed on overseas students in Britain ,  first by the Callaghan government ,  and later by the Conservatives after 1979 ,  somewhat eroded this appeal .  Above all ,  there was a general belief that ,  after three decades of social welfare and redistributive taxation ,  the spirit of Beveridge and fair shares was not dead ,  and that Britain was a far more equitable society than before the war ,  with more genuine opportunity for different classes and races .

Mrs Thatcher 's  international stature also rested on the curious chemistry of her relationship with President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union ,  but the rigour of the Prime Minister consorted somewhat uneasily with the fluid world of perestroika  ,  democratization throughout eastern Europe ,  German reunification ,  and moves towards international disarmament .  It seemed ,  in the wake of rival expulsions of alleged spies from London and Moscow ,  that Anglo - Russian relations were not as buoyant or as important as the British Prime Minister had claimed .  Meanwhile in the European Community , even with old <head>arguments</head> over the budget and farm policy removed , the British government looked like a somewhat negative force .

The worms in Lucretius explanation of inflation works as follows :  a trade union ,  because of its bargaining strength with monopoly powers ,  secures an increase in the remuneration of its members ,  say ,  5 ,  10 ,  15 per cent  what they call excessive or unjustified .  Then ,  says the theory ,  this naturally causes all the other wages and prices to go up too .  Now , the beauty of this sort of explanation , where you have everybody on your side , when you are dealing with somebody who is unpopular , when you are all desperately anxious to find a scapegoat , is that your <head>argument</head> is unlikely to be at all jealously scrutinised . As Professor Housman used to say ,  Stand on a barrel in the streets of Baghdad and say twice two are four and ginger is hot in the mouth and therefore Mohammed is the prophet of God ,  and it is unlikely that anyone would question your reasoning ;  but if he should be bold enough to do so ,  you could easily silence him by calling him a Christian dog .  So it is ,  say I in my simplistic fashion ,  that the plain ,  screaming absurdity of the statement that trade - union action causes a general rise in wages and prices escapes scrutiny .

The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment which reported in 1953  ( Cmnd .  5932 )  examined the experience of countries throughout the world where the death penalty has been abolished ,  restored ,  abolished again or where it existed in some parts and not in others .  The outcome of the analysis of this mass of evidence was indecisive as the Commission reported :  This is an issue on which it is extraordinarily difficult to find conclusive <head>arguments</head> either way The general conclusion which we have reached is that there is no clear evidence in any of the figures we have examined that the abolition of capital punishment has led to an increase in the homicide rate ,  or that its reintroduction has led to a fall .  We also reviewed such evidence as has been submitted to us about the possible relation between the number of executions in particular years and the incidence of murder in succeeding years .

In order to do this ,  however ,  Britain must herself become in some degree protectionist and place tariffs on foreign imports of at least the things which the Dominions had to sell to her  above all ,  food ,  if not also raw materials .  It was thus a revolution in British fiscal policy which Chamberlain advocated in the name of Empire ;  and from his Birmingham speech in May 1903 until he was struck down three years later his advocacy of tariff reform and his Imperial theme dominated British policies .  Yet the Imperial side of the <head>argument</head> whatever view may be taken of the fiscal , economic and domestic would not stand up to examination . If the Empire was to be welded into an economic unit ,  the parts of which would be interdependent economically because they were parts of the Empire ,  and if this unity was to stand in default or in anticipation of political unity ,  then what was necessary was Imperial free trade ,  a genuine Zollverein  .  Yet this was the last thing the Dominions would contemplate .

A similar tendency vitiates The Idea of a Christian Society  ,  with its many and lengthy endnotes .  The defence of the format of these books is that they were written as part of a struggle .

In various articles of the forties Eliot refined his material ,  whether in relating poetry to religious ritual in The Social Function of Poetry or returning to Primitive Culture  and John Layard 's  studies in the stone age New Hebrides '  in Cultural Forces in the Human Order which reworks many of the points in the earlier Notes series .

The attribution or assumption of this identity marks the creation of the homosexual .  Alan Bray and Jeffrey Weeks have given historical support to this view ,  though not without qualification ;  I remarked in Part 1 some further reservations .  Additionally , we should recall that , before the nineteenth century , the meanings of terms like sodomy and buggery might have been even wider than is suggested by Foucault 's <head>argument</head> . Sodomy was associated with witches ,  demons ,  werewolves ,  basilisks ,  foreigners ,  and  ( of course )  papists ;  and it apparently signified a wide range of practices including prostitution ,  under - age sex ,  coitus interruptus ,  and female transvestism .  Socially ,  sodomy was repeatedly equated with heresy and political treason ;  metaphysically ,  it was conceived as sexual contusion in whatever form ,  a force of anarchic disorder set against divine Creation ,  not a part of the created order but an aspect of its dissolution .

In a bizarre and disavowed way this antiquated pseudo - scientific theory of male and female sexuality might usefully recall something remarked more recently by Gayle Rubin ,  namely that modern sexual difference theory ,  far from being an expression of natural differences ,  actually involves the suppression of natural similarities  ( Traffic in Women ,  179  80 )  .  But it is not my intention to rehabilitate this theory ,   or to suggest that it is allegorically preferable to current theories of sexual difference .  My <head>argument</head> does not even assume that it was a dominant way of thinking in earlier periods . Rather I cite it here as a historical antecedent whose very strangeness alerts us to several facts relevant to what follows :  first ,  and most obviously ,  that sexual difference is not a biological given so much as a complex ideological history ;  second ,  that current theories of sexual difference are of relatively recent origin ,  and quite probably still haunted by older views ,  including this one ;  third ,  it suggests that before sexual difference the woman was once  ( and may still be )  feared in a way in which the homosexual now is  feared ,  that is ,  not so much ,  or only ,  because of a radical otherness ,  as because of an interior resemblance presupposing a certain proximity ;  the woman then ,  as the homosexual in modern psychoanalytic discourse ,  is marked in terms of lesser or retarded development .

Compared to these two cultural moments ,  even the political revolutions and great wars in modern European history are ,  I would venture ,  of the surface  (  Real Presences  ,  101 ,  94  6 )  .  Steiner and Sontag are in a sense correct about the centrality of homosexuality to modern culture .  But the <head>argument</head> of this book is that its centrality is quite otherwise than they suggest . Steiner 's  ludicrous generalizations stem in part from the very notion of defining cultures and history in terms of a sensibility .  Even a cursory look at gay history and culture suggests that the sweep and conclusions of his argument are questionable at virtually every turn ,  as indeed is the very notion of a homosexual sensibility .

So when it is argued today that the sexual deviant challenges sexual difference by denaturalizing it through parody ,  the realization of the early modern transvestite that both the deviant and the difference are effects of culture rather than nature is being revived and sophisticated .  But a residual effect of the privatizing of sexuality ,  and in particular of the construction of sexual deviance as an identity ,  a pathology of being ,  rather than a kind of behaviour in principle open to all ,  is that the challenge to this construction often itself remains imprisoned by the public/private dichotomy .  So while the whole point of the <head>argument</head> , and rightly , is that when gender is understood as culture rather than nature we see that gender is implicated in all aspects of culture , in practice the argument rarely gets oft the bed . As we shall see shortly ,  the way out of the bedroom is via the wider cultures ,  rather than the specific sexual acts ,  of transgressive reinscription  for example ,  the writings of Wilde ,  Genet ,  and others ,  the subculture from which they emerge and help to form and transform .  First there is another objection to be considered :  do deviant identities and sexualities really denaturalize through theatrical parody as straightforwardly as is sometimes suggested ?

( This point will be returned to below .  )   The debate on overseas government expenditure in the crucial period leading up to the sterling crisis of 1947 can be characterized ,  in broad terms ,  as a battle between Dalton and Attlee on the one side ,  and Bevin and the service chiefs on the other. However , Attlee 's position was a complex one : he was more ready than anyone to criticize strategic <head>arguments</head> used to justify such expenditure , but was never willing to push the arguments to the extent of causing a serious rift with Bevin , who was perhaps the key minister in the government after Attlee . When Keynes 's  memorandum was discussed in Cabinet in February 1946 ,  defence expenditure for 1946/7 had already been cut by 14 per cent .  But there was a marked reluctance to accept that the situation was as serious as Keynes portrayed it  ( a portrayal broadly supported by a paper from the Balance of payments Working party )  .

He hoped that the strategic assumption that it was vital to us to keep open the Mediterranean and that in fact we could ,  should be re - examined .

If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring ,  then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques ,  for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach  ( 1982 )  is the very stuff of anthropology .  And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens ,  then it seems essential it should be identified ,  assessed ,  and described .  Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an <head>arm</head> of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing beginning to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly ,  and herein lies the first problem for the researcher .  For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to  the direction of power ?

Given this premise ,  we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards ;  it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents '  Association conference not only supporting this motion ,  but arguing for the creation of twenty - four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad .  Always the call will be for more power to the organization ,  so that the 1989 cry of alarm from the Police Federation conference about private security firms is based more on a fear that areas of influence are being taken from the institution than on beliefs that such groups are incompetent .  In a similar fashion , all the representative bodies of the police ACPO , the Superintendents ' Association , and the Police Federation were outraged at the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act in the mid - 1980s ; for one area of police power in the courts had been removed at one fell swoop and given to another <head>arm</head> of the executive . So although in a liberal democracy it would seem practical and even suitable for the police to have a say in the way order is defined and maintained ,  as Foucault  ( 1970 )  and Douglas  ( 1987 )  have shown ,  this will inevitably take on an expansionist line ;  for anything other than bland support of the proposals of the institution will present a challenge or pose a threat .  This dilemma generates the paradox I have outlined above ,  where intellectualism and graduate recruitment become prized commodities and are publicly sought after as the organization seeks to elaborate its professionalism ,  but are simultaneously denigrated .

Notice that the blocking hand is not pulled into a fist .  Instead it is turned forwards and hooks over the opponent 's  leading guard hand .  This hooking action is important because it interferes with the opponent 's attempts to free his <head>arm</head> and keeps him closed off for a longer period . Use any opportunity to force the opponent 's  front hand across his own centre - line since this always inhibits his immediate responses .  provided that you then turn your body directly towards him ,  you will be able to deliver a powerful scoring punch .

Having said that ,  if you weigh only 60 kg  ( 132 lb )  and yet still manage to sit your 90 kg  ( 198 lb )  opponent down with a solid thump to his mid - section ,  then the refereeing panel may well applaud your fervour with a full point .  Obviously ,  you cannot rely on a hard landing in the case of face punches ,  so other means must be employed .  Even in the case of front <head>arm</head> jabs , the distance travelled should be maximised and the action demonstrated as a thrust rather than a snap . Many valid front punches are not scored because they travel such short distances at high speed ,  and are  snapped back before the panel can react .  A thrusting action should accompany all linear punches and kicks ,  since it is believed to be related to potential power in a way that a snapping action is not.

The main function of pecs is to adduct the arms  ( adduction is a movement towards the centre - line of the body )  ,  that is they move the upper arms across the body as in dumb - bell flyes .  Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion , which draws the <head>arm</head> forwards and upwards , and shoulder extension , which draws the arm down and forwards . By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .  To develop the pecs fully it is necessary to be aware of how much development there is already ,  and whether that development is well balanced .

( Weights can be attached to the waist to make the dips much harder .  )  The use of cables ,  if available ,  is excellent for bringing out the definition at the centre of the chest  ( origin )  due to the fact that they allow movement over the body 's  centre - line without loss of tension .  Pectoral decks emphasise the outer part of the pecs near the insertion into the humerus ( upper <head>arm</head> ) . They also relieve stress on the elbows .  If women fully develop the lower pec muscles ,  the result is that the bust is pushed out by large underlying muscles ,  thus seeming larger .

The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint ,  and they are attached at one end to the upper arm and at the other end to 3 points to the front ,  top and back of the shoulder .  The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front ,  the side and the rear .  All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements , but the direction of the <head>arm</head> movement determines which head is being used the most . The most impressive shoulder development shows an equal development of all 3 heads of the deltoids .  However ,  this is not very easy to achieve .

Fig. 6 Back muscles The lateral and posterior heads should always be trained with specific exercises .  The best exercise for the lateral deltoid is dumb - bell side - lateral raises ( remember to only raise the <head>arms</head> to the horizontal because after this the upper trapezius will be used ) , The posterior deltoid is the least enjoyable to train , but should never be missed out . This head is worked hard by bent - over dumb - bell laterals or bent - over cable laterals if a cable cross - over machine is available .  It is unlikely that you will need to train the anterior deltoid specifically ,  but if you do then the straight arm dumb - bell raises to the front are excellent .

There are 3 heads to the triceps ;  2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade .  The group has a single tendon insertion below the elbow into the forearm .  The function of the triceps is to straighten the arm , therefore at the end of each exercise the <head>arms</head> should be locked out straight . If this is  not done then the full range of triceps movement has not been achieved and full contraction will not be carried out ,  thus inhibiting development .  To develop more size heavy basic exercises must be done ,  for example close grip bench presses ,  reverse grip bench presses ,  dips ,  push - downs and lying extensions .

If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps ,  twenty - three pas de bourre  ,  seven glissades  and so on .  The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have produced principles of calm and  -  spacious movement .  But technical descriptions only indicate the positions through which the feet and legs should move and at which moment they should co - ordinate with the <head>arms</head> as weight is transferred from one step and pose to the next . There are few ,  if any ,  suggestions of how individual movements can be linked together to achieve some expressive or rhythmic quality suitable to the style of dance required by the plot ,  theme and/or music .  if choreographers wish to make their design more interesting they should attempt to give each step and pose some distinctive quality or unusual place in the design ,  which may or may not break the old conventions .

The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes  and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty ,  just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .  The Fourth Fairy is a songbird bringing the gift of Language and flutters to and fro as she sings .  The Fifth Fairy has fast stabbing movements of feet and <head>arms</head> to bring the gift of Energy . The Lilac Fairy is generously slow and controlled and taps her forehead because she is bringing the gift of Wisdom  ( the traditional gesture for wise )  .  It is the gesture she uses later to make the Prince think what he must do to wake Aurora .

Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow .  It breaks the continuity of the dance .  Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the <head>arms</head> through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras . This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering  as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov 's  music .  But this would get very boring if used too often .

Therefore in daily training it is customary for each exercise to be performed to the left and right ,  forwards and backwards .  But even if a choreographer breaks such regularity when setting a classical ballet he usually balances the pattern made on the floor in one enchanement  by another moving in the opposite direction .  This balancing of floor patterns is also matched by the rise and fall of the dancers ' bodies , heads and <head>arms</head> . It is very noticeable in Petipa 's  ballets ,  particularly in all the corps de ballet  work of The Sleeping Beauty  .  Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .

some actors today ,  notably Sir John Gielgud ,  use them when playing in classical drama and some eighty are still part of a dancer 's  means of telling a story in classical style .  They have become part of the spacious ports de bras  used during the dance .  They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must appear to pass through the centre line of the <head>arm</head> from shoulder to finger - tips and move within the two circles drawn by the elbows and hands . Two of the best examples occur when the Lilac Fairy casts the spell that sends Aurora to sleep in The Sleeping Beauty  ,   (  Until a prince comes ,  sees her ,  falls in love and kisses her awake .   '  and when Siegfried swears to marry and save Odette after she has told him how the wicked Von Rothbart turned her into a Swan  ( Swan Lake  ,  Act 11 )  .

In his Scottish dances Bournonville highlighted the Highland characteristic of an upwards lift from the floor on the first beat of a bar whereas in English and French dance the movement is downwards .  This makes the Scottish footwork look very light and easy particularly as it is allied to the steps of petit  and grand allegro  he also used .  Another important feature is the absolute co - ordination of the <head>arms</head> as they change in the ports de bras , often moving through the 1st position . The change usually occurs on the first beat of a bar or phrase ,  which eliminates any fussiness when the footwork is intricate .  Ashton maintained these formal changes in his frivolous Scottish Rhapsody .

Boy chases girl and catches her in a fond embrace without pausing as they cover the stage with footwork of a speed rarely seen elsewhere .

If this is danced to 6/8 it leads to the very swift footwork needed fur Massine 's  tarantella and Ashton 's  version of the Italian pas de deux  in Swan Lake  ,  a miracle of timing and quick changes of auiement  .  This type of dancing to a dotted rhythm also leads to many steps where the dancers hop continuously on one leg holding the other firmly in attitude devant  ,  retire  ,  or stretched backwards .  Like Scottish ports de bras , those of Italy are very simple , the <head>arms</head> changing places after each sequence of dotted steps or hops . As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .

However when Fokine staged A  Night of Egypt   ( later Cleopatra  )  he went a great deal further and developed a more particular Eastern style inspired by the performance of some Siamese dancers .  He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum ,  Leningrad .  From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the <head>arms</head> and hands . Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands ,  which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body ,  very often with a twist sideways at the waist .  This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .

This is shown vividly when ,  left finally alone ,  she strikes a dramatic pose of complete withdrawal from love and happiness .  Dorabella 's  playfulness is similar to that of Natalia 's  ward ,  Vera ,  when she first dances in A Month in the Country ,   .  The carefree quality disappears when she shyly tries to tell the Tutor how fond she has become of him , and when she discovers Natalia and the Tutor in each other 's <head>arms</head> , she loses all inhibitions to denounce them . Her shy confession of love is in deep contrast to that of Natalia ,  who cannot wait to show that her emotions are fully aroused when left alone with the same man. It is in these brief intimate scenes that Ashton exploits the difference between youth fulling in love and experience demanding it ,  because Natalia is used to getting her own way .

Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes  in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints ,  thus the dancers '  bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile .  The angles made at the elbows ,  shoulders ,  knees and ankle joints are clearly visible .  Those of the <head>arms</head> are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves . The dancers drawing these straight ,  angled and very slightly rounded lines have to work accurately and be correctly aligned with their neighbours in each temporary grouping .  Each grouping has to be correctly aligned with the other whether it precedes ,  balances or follows another .

French set to reject Deloitte merger By SIMON PINCOMBE THE PROPOSED international merger between Deloitte Haskins Sells and Touche Ross is likely to be holed below the waterline this week when the French <head>arm</head> of Deloitte pulls out of the agreement . The French firm is expected to follow the example of Deloitte UK by joining forces with Coopers  Lybrand instead .  But unlike Deloitte UK ,  which declined to join the proposed Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu  ( DRT )  ,  the French practice has already signed up.

In the late 1970s British insurance brokers were takeover targets of their larger rivals in the United States .  Then ,  in the 1980s ,  overseas financial groups have had large British insurance companies within their sights ,  which has led to aggressively fought takeovers .  The wave of acquisitions has been prompted by expansionist desires among the overseas financial groups , which see opportunities to increase market share and provide themselves , in the case of the acquisition of insurance companies , with new marketing and product design <head>arms</head> . In some cases ,  overseas groups have just taken speculative shareholdings in British insurance companies in the hope that their interest may flush out other buyers .  The latest ,  and the largest of the takeovers came last week with the offer of 1.1bn by Australian Mutual Provident ,  Australia 's  largest life insurance company ,  for Pearl Group ,  a leading British life insurer .

By ANDY GLINIECKI WHEELCLAMPING of cars is deterring drivers from parking on yellow lines and illegally parking in residents '  bays ,  according to a new report .  Published by the research <head>arm</head> of the Department of Transport , the report comes shortly after the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham announced it would be introducing the scheme later this month . So far no local authorities outside London have approached the department about the implementation of wheelclamping .  Surveys of parking habits by the deparment 's  Transport and Road Research Laboratory carried out before and after wheelclamping was extended to the areas of St John 's  Wood and Pimlico in London in spring 1987 ,  show that parking on yellow lines declined by 31 and 17 per cent respectively .

Nicholas Ridley added to the general glee by saying the Government was in favour of legislation .

Indeed , there is a strong argument that stretching the long <head>arm</head> of the law to the innocent hacker could escalate rather than curb serious crime . Emma Nicholson 's  Private Member 's  Bill against hackers ,  which failed to make the grade in the last session of Parliament ,  required anyone who entered a computer to his or anyone else 's  advantage ,  or to another 's  prejudice ,  to be charged with a serious offence ,  with a maximum penalty of 10 years .  The Law Commission has been much more exact in specifying intent to commit serious crime as a necessary ingredient for one of the two more serious offences it proposes .

Parents and children stretch out flailing <head>arms</head> towards each other in fumbling efforts to communicate .

Other stalling techniques are also deployed to detain them in the station on such days  ( prolonging station business ,  extended conversations in parts of the station where they are less visible to management ,  carrying messages ,  and so on )  .  But ,  as a general principle ,  Northern Ireland 's  social divisions ensure that police management prefer neighbourhood police to be on the street ,  as is their purpose ,  and in practice about three - quarters of the normal shift is taken up with beat duty ,  which is much higher than in Great Britain .  But there is a reverse to this , for wider security concerns require that neighbourhood men accomplish community policing equipped with at least a side - <head>arm</head> , sometimes more , flak jacket and baton , as well as personal radio . For some calls they wear plain clothes ,  but mostly work is done in uniform ,  as it must be if neighbourhood policing is to work .  Moreover ,  each patch has to be walked by two men :  one providing cover for the other while he polices his beat ,  so that each spends only half of the shift on their particular area .

Discretionary grants for further education have suffered in the climate of recent economic cuts and local government spending allowances can affect the number and level of grants awarded .  Generally ,  a local authority will aim to cover the full cost of fees and a living allowance although this can be subject to your personal circumstances and will vary depending on whether you will live with your parents during term time ,  or in rented accommodation .  It is possible that your local authority may <head>ask</head> you to audition for them after you have been offered a place . This seems an odd  way of going about things ,  but the advising panels do carry a professional adviser so that talent is not merely being judged by local civil servants .  The object of this rather clumsy piece of administration is to place some check on the expenditure of local money on the arts  and also to provide a further checkpoint on students who have already received educational grants for other careers .

By now you will have made a definite decision to become an actor  no matter what the problems or obstacles .  The next step is to prepare for the audition at a drama school and find the right kind of textual material which will allow you to show the best of yourself .  On obtaining a prospectus and <head>asking</head> for an application form , you will find that every drama school will require an audition fee , and this can vary between 15 and 25 . If you can afford to ,  it 's  generally best to spread your auditions around the drama schools so that you are seen more than once .  When auditioning for most schools you will be asked to present at least two contrasting speeches and possibly give some idea of your attitude to improvisation and ,  perhaps ,  to singing .

Not all auditions have just two speeches ,  classical and modern .

In some schools you will be <head>asked</head> to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school ) and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre ) . The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .  Rigidity of approach is something to be avoided at all costs  there is no point in being able to do a party piece one way and be unable to take in new direction on the same material .

Auditions are  nerve - wracking for everyone who does them  ( and for that matter ,  for everyone who watches them )  but  being sure of your text is the least you can do .  Should that unthinkable thing happen ,  and you forget your lines ,  do n't despair .  A sympathetic panel may well <head>ask</head> you to start again . But there is no trick to the business of learning lines ,  as you will find out as you go on  although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production ,  because then you will be operating with other actors around you .  On the whole ,  acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system ,  which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show .

READ THE MANUAL FIRST THERE'S a saying in the computer industry :  If in doubt ,  press a few keys ;  if that does n't work ,  ask a colleague ;  if in deep trouble ,  consult the manual .  There is some justification for this caricature of the typical computer user though customers ' critics might <head>ask</head> themselves first how well - written the manuals are , before complaining that people never read them . Assuming the manual is in comprehensible English ,  users can avoid many unnecessary calls to the help desk by a combination of consulting its index ,  and using the onscreen help built into the software .  Pabulum Consultants '  Jennifer Rust adds :  They could also help themselves by thinking through a problem before phoning the support desk .

For a start ,  it is not the hardiest of perennials ;  not surprisingly considering that it hails from Uruguay .

You will understand when you see its handsome dark green leathery leaves and startling gold - eyed daisies ,  their cerise - magenta ray florets in branched heads 11/2ft above the ground .

For example ,  checking the items in the wrong order is totally unacceptable because it can so easily lead to missing something out altogether .  A re - check should never be necessary ,  since this only implies the acceptance of a half - hearted check in the first place .  The idea of having the person attaching the cable <head>ask</head> if the airbrakes are closed and locked has been introduced in some clubs to try and prevent incidents where pilots take off with their airbrakes unlocked . However ,  if you are going to re - check the airbrakes ,  it would seem logical to check all the items in the check - list as well .  Many instructors are not careful ,  or thoughtful enough about either their initial teaching or their subsequent monitoring of their students as they do their own cockpit checks .

Its early implementation met with a degree of resistance ,  for the new system fundamentally dislocates the well established and cultural preferences of the service .  Inspectors can no longer hide behind a paper managing a desk  ( quote from a Chief Superintendent )  .  Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and <head>ask</head> them to translate 6.358 million into real men , for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind . In effect their fiscal mandate meant their version of reality failed to synchronize with the police world view .  Constantly the symbolic or qualitative nature of police culture  slips through the grasp of the researcher or the audit analysis ,  simply because of its ephemeral potential for statistical assessment .

I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was  one of the social sciences ,  perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which asked why ,  if anthropology is not approved ,  have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship ,  on full pay and allowances ?  Just over a year later , at a Career Appraisal Interview with the chief constable , I was <head>asked</head> : tell me , how did you find the law course at the polytechnic ? I pointed out that I had not been to the polytechnic ,  but had been to Durham University on a scholarship  only the second the force had been awarded .

I had discussed the problems of insider analysis with him at a 1988 Police Conference ,  where he described how ,  on return to his force after his undergraduate degree ,  he had asked for permission to publish research material .

( again in written report ) and was informed reasons were never given ; the official line was simply to refuse all such requests . Not unexpectedly ,  this officer left the police and moved into academic life .

Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be <head>asking</head> of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .  There are no plans to establish such a centre .  No one seems to have <head>asked</head> whether the Staff College could have taken on this job , but then again such anti - intellectualism is apparent even in the Bramshill Scholars ' Association . In 1985 ,  they proposed to extend their role beyond that of an annual dining club for officers who had taken a degree through the police college scheme .  It was mooted the association

The emphasis of this directed  ( or controlled ?  )  research ,  it was announced ,  is to be on pragmatic ,  problem - solving enquiries  ( i.e. policy - orientated research )  ,  which ,  it was explained ,  would be of cost - effective advantage to the force .  There seems to be little chance of any philosophical ,  unprogrammatic enquiry here which might be critical of the system ;  and no espionage from within !  This cost - effective nature of a scholarship was a matter I had been <head>asked</head> to justify when I first asked my new assistant chief constable about the potential of postgraduate research as an observing participator . I had mentioned the unquantifiable public relationships which could be generated during a secondment and argued for the intangible value of the many hundreds of contacts I had made which could not easily be costed in purely fiscal terms .  He dismissed this as irrelevant and his use of metaphor ,  in what  turned out to be an eighty - minute interview ,  was most revealing .

And surely ,  it can be argued ,  the understanding of what is to be ordered and who is to be disciplined has long been defined and subject to the practical mastery of the controllers .  In consequence ,  even when the insider retires and ostensibly leaves the family ,  he will be expected to maintain his silence ,  and although bland hagiographic biography has been acceptable in the past ,  there has been no place for the espionage of critical ethnography .  And even as the unlamented Official Secrets Act of 1911 groaned in its death throes in the late 1980s ( to be replaced by an even more constraining measure ) , officers about to retire in West Mercia were presented with an official force form and <head>asked</head> to sign a Declaration under the Act . This reiterates the whole catch - all section 2 of the Official Secrets Act of 1911 ,  as well as the scale of punishments laid down by the Official Secrets Act of 1920 for those who possess any secret official code word ,  or password ,  or sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  document or information which relates to or is used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place ,  or which has been made or obtained in contravention of this Act ,  or which has been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under Her Majesty or which  he has obtained or to which he has had access owing to his position as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract  and who  ( a )  communicates the code word ,  pass word ,  sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  document ,  or information to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it ,  or a person to whom it is in the interest of the State his duty to communicate it ,  or  ( aa )  uses the information in his possession for the benefit of any foreign power or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State ,  or  ( b )  retains the sketch ,  plan ,  model ,  article ,  note ,  or document in his possession or control when he has no right to retain it or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it ,  or fails to comply with all directions issued by lawful authority with regard to the return or disposal thereof ,  or

By reducing the social space between the dichotomies of ordered law enforcers and uncontrolled prigs ,  the detective necessarily returns a degree of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler is always structured to deny .  The lowly polis ,  with little or no power in the system ,  deplores this situation and complains of its escalation ,  while the detectives moan about the incompetence of the uniform wollies who never get close enough to their prisoners to extract their own coughs or admissions and who fail to understand that the system largely depends on the ability of the department to manipulate a statistical norm in detected crimes .  Stead ( 1980 : 305 ) , like Mervyn Jones ( 1980 ) , has also pointed out how police organization attributes low status to beat work , and <head>asks</head> the service to reconsider the value of the patrol officer : I would enter a plea that I have often made that the street officer 's  authority and discretion should be given better recognition .  It has always seemed to me rather sad that almost any move from beat duty is regarded as a promotion .

resulted in the controllers making a puritan attack directed at the drug taking of the  ( underground )  movement ;  and since the drug - scene is complex and confused ,  and we have little time in which to develop a reliable folk - lore about drugs and how to take them  ( as we have long ago done about alcohol )  ,  they have been particularly successful in fostering anxiety among teachers ,  parents and establishment figures .  Our part in this controlling puritan attack consisted of making the occasional arrest ,  while pursuing the unquantifiable social role which filled most of our time .  Furlong is correct , however , in suggesting that anxiety was rife , and because of this and establishment obsessions with a belief in a statistical truth we were constantly being <head>asked</head> to give numerical estimates of how many there were out there who were fixing , using the weed , or dropping acid . During the first three years of full - time drug squad work  ( 19668 )  arrests totalled some sixty - four persons  or less than two per month .  In this same period I saw many hundreds of users who never featured in the arrest tables and took many to hospital .

It can be likened to becoming them or no longer being us ,  for I had further increased my distance from the working lives of the real polises and had moved out of their known world to become an outsider ,  a liminal mover .

He was now in the CID in the city and somewhat tentatively <head>asked</head> what subject I was reading . He seemed relieved when I told him I was reading anthropology and ,  looking somewhat apprehensively over his shoulder at the sociology building ,  he muttered well thank goodness you 're not taking bloody sociology ,  with all those left wing bastards who hate the polis .  An inspector who came to Durham at the same time as myself to read Law and the Sociology of Law ,  found the latter course  required a move to concepts outside normal police experience .

The actor is no different ,  although for some reason it is often thought that you are somehow ready to act ,  magically ,  the moment you enter a stage door .  Look after yourself ,  and particularly your voice and your memory ,  for without these you are dead meat .  So much of professional life is spent in the competitive <head>atmosphere</head> of interviews and auditions that a chance to work on themselves constructively and together is something actors relish . Since 1980 professional training courses have proliferated and many can be found in and around London .  All of them take the working actors '  problems into account and attempt to create classes which can make free hours both disciplined and profitable .

They merited John Ash 's  epithet old - fashioned modernism ,  and most of all Jaim Manrique 's  judgement ,  that the secret of Lorca 's  appeal  is nostalgia  :  His art does not deepen as we grow older !  he said ,  another trait the Canadian shared with the Spaniard .  His brother ,  Francisco Garia Lorca ,  has very finely defined the canciones  ,  one of the most notable poetic forms used by Lorca ,  as a lyric in which :  the poet checks his first flights in order to achieve greater purification The <head>atmosphere</head> of transcendental romantic sensibility gives way to fleeting states of mind , momentary sensations , or a disinterested humour , often imbued with a note of elegiac melancholy . Moreover ,  Lorca influenced Leonard 's  world - view too ;  his transcendental and far - reaching ideas about life touched him :  Lorca changed my way of being and thinking radically ,  he told a Spanish journalist .  His books taught me that poetry can be pure and profound ,  and at the same time popular .

Alternatively ,  the choreographer may be inspired by a piece of music and wish to bring it to life in dance  ( see page 41 )  .  There are three types of music from which to choose .

On the other hand ,  Charles Mackerras '  wonderful pot - pourri of tunes from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas for Pineapple Poll  displayed how well he has caught not only the humour but also the pathos of The Bum Boat Woman 's  Story .  Choreographers should also study John Lanchbery 's  sensitive handling of some lesser - known Chopin music for Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  and his equally successful score for Ashton 's  film ,  The Tales of Beatrix Potter  .  He based the latter on his research into Victorian and Edwardian salon music and showed what can be done by looking into such highways and byways of music when a particular period <head>atmosphere</head> is needed .

Since Fokine broke away from the rigid categories of dance or mime ,  twentieth - century choreographers ,  following his example ,  have usually created a continuous design of expressive movement which interprets the story by means of mimed dance or danced mime  ( see page 58 )  .  The stories can range from the most tragic such as The Rake 's  Progress  ,  Romeo and Juliet  and Mayerling  to the lyrical fantasy of The Dream  and from the subtle and poignant A Month in the Country  to the happily funny La Fille Mal Garde  or the rumbustious Pineapple Poll  .  But no matter whether the ballet lasts one , two or three acts the choreographer must be fully in control of his material so that every detail of the characterisation of the whole cast is appropriate to the general <head>atmosphere</head> and environment within which the plot unfolds . This is particularly important in a three - act ballet where any temptation to display dance for its own sake can lead to the introduction of divertissements  merely to fill in time or show off all the dancers in the company ,  but is not concerned with the unfolding of the story .  Petipa was often accused of doing this ,  the best example being the dances by characters from other fairy tales who come to Aurora 's  wedding  (  The Sleeping Beauty  .  )

Can certain individuals be directed in such a way that they stand out from the mass because they are the tellers of the story ,  the chief exponents in the drama or theme ?

Or must they remain part of the mass , in other words the corps de ballet , because they are needed to create the proper <head>atmosphere</head> , state the location , suggest the mood and very often respond to whatever is taking place ?

The heroines of such ballets go hunting ,  practise archery ,  play lutes or mandolins ,  dance appropriate period dances and generally behave as to the manner born in aristocratic surroundings .  They arrive on stage in strict order of precedence ,  the noblest usually arriving last so that the lesser characters can look on in suitable admiration ,  whilst the servants  ( the corps de ballet  )  keep their distance .  This acceptance of the usual forms of court etiquette was first developed in a particular social environment , and it is important to comply with it if a proper <head>atmosphere</head> is to be established for the action which is to take place .

Her role has the same sobering effect on the <head>atmosphere</head> of the ballet as that of Bratfisch , the Count 's valet , in Mayerling . Harlequin ,  in his earlier embodiment as Hermes ,  was the god of animals and this idea has been another valuable source of choreographic material .

He realised ,  as did later choreographers ,  that the steps and patterns of such material had to be properly displayed to the audience ,  not just danced for themselves .  In other words he opened up the circles ,  squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .  It is this opening up and exposure of traditional dance that is so important when choreographers attempt to give a realistic <head>atmosphere</head> to the style and expression of their work . They should remember that they are suggesting and not giving the actual location .  In real life the onlookers are part of the activity and usually join in .

( As played by the Moscow Arts Theatre ,  Turgenev 's  A Month in the  Country  takes over two hours ,  Ashton 's  ballet roughly half an hour .  )  Only characters and episodes essential to the plot are retained .

MacMillan and Ashton understood this and emphasised the main action .  Their work should be studied by all would - be choreographers .

Everything is open to interpretation ,  usually by the police ,  and the poor ,  hard - pressed licensee and his customers are so confused that the usual solution is to avoid the problem and not let children into the pub at all .  While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .  Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and , no matter how good the facilities may be , you often feel excluded from the main <head>atmosphere</head> of the pub . I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax ,  drink ,  talk and eat in a proper pub atmosphere .  What is needed is a relaxation of the law as it now stands to allow the controlled admission of children to certain pubs at certain times of day .

On the verge of tears ,  Mr Wolk went on television to appeal to people to refrain from taking to the streets ,  and urged them instead to keep a lit candle in their window .

To give the farcical complications a kick - start ,  Poiret asks us to believe that a man ,  finding himself in this predicament ,  would try to pass the bimbo off as his daughter from a former marriage ,  and that the girl ,  required to account for her surprise visit ,  would blurt out that she was pregnant .  This dodge would not be completely incredible ,  of course ,  if the participants were dense or desperate enough ,  but in Christopher Renshaw 's  production ,  they seem to be neither ,  and particularly not the latter .  Throughout , the <head>atmosphere</head> is too casual , and in addition to a grave lack of frantic drivenness , there is a marked absence of the erotic . After all ,  the situation bulges with seedy potential :  a man about to have sex with a girl young enough to be his daughter is suddenly forced to pose as her father .  Farce likes to tinker with such taboos .

The job demands intense concentration ;  even with six pairs of hands grabbing ,  the flow is almost too fast to be dealt with precisely .

In the old days it needed a team of 20 women to do the equivalent job  and even then they did it less than half as fast .  Couldn't get em now ,  says the farmer 's  wife scornfully .

Webern 's  Six Orchestral Pieces ,  still perceptibly Romantic even with the pruned wind band of 1928 ,  emerged under Simon Rattle with enormous personality .

There was lots of marvellous playing with sensitive string sound and excellent wind solos ,  but the whole was too clear an image of Ravel 's  subtle settings .

But a fault in the computer controlling one of the engines has forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  ( Nasa )  to delay the launch until at least Monday .

Nasa won the first round of the legal battle on Tuesday ,  when a federal judge refused to order the launch be postponed .

This noble idea was all very well in the relatively lax <head>atmosphere</head> and control of early NEP , with only one unique educational experiment involved . Yet even at this time many members of industrial trade unions realized fully that they were no longer free agents in a wider collective ,  but increasingly regimented subjects of the Party. The aim of creating a sense of prime loyalty among members of the colony ,  which was small enough for them to know each other ,  did not constitute any kind of a threat to central authorities in 1922 ,  but it would not have been tolerated in the 1930s ,  when family members were encouraged to spy on one another in the state interest .

A new - build scheme providing equivalent accommodation would be exempt from this tax .  Only if a building is listed can this significant premium on construction costs be avoided ,  although the majority of disused churches which are offered for conversion are of listed status .

This mood might question the suitability of making the radical alterations to the aisle roof and the almost equally severe remodelling of the south slope of the nave roof which were implemented here  ( Plates 24 and 25 )  .  Although it is clear that these changes were made in order to admit light to the new ,  deep - plan living accommodation ,  it is conceivable that the judicious use of ranges of standard reversible and ventilating roof windows might have provided an answer to this requirement which would have been less erosive of the original external appearance .

The emphasis is on reflection .  In the new jazz climate ,  the anonymity of Peter King ,  one of the unsung great British saxophonists ,  has lifted a little  partly because one of his admirers is Ben Watt of Everything But The Girl ,  who is also the producer of Crusade .  Given that background , the album is unsurprisingly pop - influenced , with a velvety studio <head>atmosphere</head> , tunes by Smokey Robinson , Donny Hathaway and Joni Mitchell , even a funk version of Blue Monk . It all represents King a little too effectively marketed to tingle the skin ,  but underneath it all there is the same fluidity ,  the same lightning double - time runs ,  the same sense of shape ,  declaring that repackaging cannot really cramp his style .  The opposite extreme is represented by the Russian saxophonist ,  Vladimir Chekasin ,  sometime member of the Ganelin Trio ,  caught here live on the Munster Jazz Festival .

The minimal sculptures by Araeen and Avtarjeet Danjal have a dated ,  anonymous air .  To my surprise , the space devoted to the kinetic sculptures by David Medalla had a lively and progressive <head>atmosphere</head> . The old Signals Gallery ,  largely Medalla 's  creation ,  was one of the last places where one found the undirected avant - guardism of post - war years .  By 1965 or so this had all gone ,  but Medalla himself has been too bouncy and inventive to obey the arid strictures of minimalism .

NEXT time Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra perform Messiaen 's  Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum they should do it in a great cathedral .  Not a modest one like St Asaph ,  where the gong and tam - tam crescendos of the third movement would be damagingly deafening ,  but in some vast Gothic building where the acoustic reverberations would be as effective as the spiritual associations in enhancing the effect of the piece .  In a place with an acoustic as dry and an <head>atmosphere</head> as worldly as Birmingham Town Hall it does n't work . Indeed ,  without the ecclesiastical aura ,  the passages of massively slow - moving melody ,  unadorned and sometimes unharmonised ,  can sound too plain and even too thin in texture .  The birdsong episodes in the third and fourth movements ,  projected in brilliant colours and vital rhythms on this occasion ,  can only benefit from concert - hall clarity ,  it is true .

At no time will this be more true than in the 1990s ,  when the art critic confronts an increasingly international community of art .  Of course ,  surveys will continue to be written about American painting or German art ,  British sculpture or Australian print - making ;  this fact of publication does not mean that these activities have an inner coherence .  Any reader is entitled to ask what purpose such national anthologies serve ; their best justification is making art more accessible , enabling those living artists represented to find and hold on to <head>audiences</head> for their work . The reader can beware of an element of self - interest in such anthologies ,  whether in the form of books or exhibitions .  For one thing ,  a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies .

The standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high ,  but not always attained .  Comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism ,  while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience .  A lecture <head>audience</head> looking at a slide projection , incidentally , may also suffer from seeing distorted colours , though art museums take some care to sell transparencies of a satisfactory quality . Considerations of illustrations aside ,  the reader will be hoping for enlightenment from the text .  It is probable that this will have much to offer .

The quotation is from an article of 1954 ,  at a time when Picasso 's  reputation was very high .  Heron was anxious to point out Braque 's  qualities ,  so he trailed his coat openly .   To suggest , as I do , that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary <head>audience</head> , fed to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzied novelty and every sort of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's  work ,  which ,  incidentally ,  was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time .

This is as unsatisfactory as reading about a picture which is not illustrated .  The crux of a personality article is that it aims to satisfy a reader 's  curiosity .  An editor 's directions to the writer of an article may be to take a populist approach , suitable for a wide <head>audience</head> . The article written to this brief is likely to have an element of sensationalism ;  curiosity about sex or money may be deliberately aroused ;  conflicts in an artist 's  life are likely to be dramatised .  An amusing parallel in the film business is an account given by the director Ken Russell of how he sold the idea of making a film about Tchaikowsky ;  he described it to his potential backers as the story of a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the <head>audience</head> into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively ) . It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .   The film is a very distinct dramatic medium .

Depending on the school ,  a full term 's  work of ten to twelve weeks may be spent on one production project during the first term ,  with either a workshop or text study area at the end of the period .

a tribute to muriel box  ( 19051991 )  It was to her own surprise that Muriel Box ,  the director of 14 modest budget feature films between 1951 and 1964 ,  found herself an inspiration and a role model for a new generation of women film - makers ,  critics and students .

Her first husband was Sydney Box ,  the writer - director who became head of production at Gainsborough Studios ;  and her sister - in - law was the Miss Box Office who produced the wildly successful DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE films over two decades .  But Muriel 's  climb to film direction was slow and gradual ,  and she began her apprenticeship as a typist and then continuity girl ,  rising throughout the studio hierarchy .

Colonial power ,  religious belief ,  separation ,  racist oppression ,  migration ,  miscegenation ,  black politics ,  music ,  adventure ,  desire ,  passion ,  pleasure are the themes touched upon by some of the films being screened .

These labels prove to be wholly inadequate ,  not to say misleading ,  for a film - maker who managed to bring together Indian mythological symbolism ,  folk and musical traditions in order to raise questions about identity ,  nation ,  race ,  and class in a unparalleled way .

He told his <head>audience</head> that C.I.D . officers use deception ,  trickery and psychologically oriented persuasive tactics amounting to threats and inducements ,  in order to obtain confessions ;  and this process is potentiated by the custodial environment .

Amongst the most important of these carefully plotted works are :  de Falla 's  The  Three - Cornered Hat   ( 1919 )  which originally accompanied a mime play and so fascinated Diaghilev that he commissioned the composer to enlarge it for Massine 's  ballet  ( see page 59 )  ;  Vaughan William 's  Job ,  commissioned by Diaghilev ,  was unused until de Valois created her important Masque for Dancing  ( 1931 )   ( this marked the inaugural performance of what has become The Royal Ballet )  ;  Arthur Bliss '  Checkmate   ( 1937 )  was choreographed by de Valois after both composer and choreographer had worked on the plot ;  Prokofiev 's  Romeo and Juliet  was composed with the help of a Shakespearean theatre expert and has been used notably by Lavrovsky ,  Ashton and MacMillan  ( see page 26 )  ;  and Ashton provided a roughly outlined plot for Hans Werner Henze 's  score for Ondine   ( 1958 )  .  But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine ,  such as Apollo ,  Orpheus  and Card Game  .  During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy <head>audiences</head> always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six . These were Milhaud ,  Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert ,  many of their works remain in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's  moving interpretation of Poulenc 's  Gloria  .  When choreographers decide to commission music ,  they should first give the composer an outline of the plot ,  roughly suggesting the sequence of the action ,  the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved .

But there is no such careful blending of ingredients in Tetley 's  Dances of Albion  where the singer 's  words of the traditional Lye Wake Dirge bore no relation to what was being danced on stage .  This was offensive to the Scots in the audience as was Tetley 's  disregard for the purport of the poem by Blake that gave the ballet its title .  The music by Benjamin Britten includes some part of the War Requiem which means far more to British <head>audiences</head> than mere decorative patterning . Choreographers have never disdained to use popular music for their everincreasing audiences and they realise that they should reflect popular taste .  The score for La Fille Mal Garde   ( 1789 )  reflected the new revolutionary ideas pervading France and contained several folk and popular airs .

The ballet works itself out consistently as a design ,  reproducing in the subtlest way the design of the music in the matter of subject ,  repetitions ,  balancings ,  treatment of episodes and so on .  In the last resort ,  the more musical we are and the better we know Brahms ,  the more pleasure we derive from Choreartium  .  Ernest Newman 's remarks stress that choreographers creating dance to their own choice of music must study how the composer has structured his score and try to understand what he intended the <head>audience</head> to hear and feel , whether it be played , or played and sung . Choreographers have to create dance movements which make their response to the music visible before the performers can communicate the music .  A socalled abstract or dance ballet has to be both thought and felt if the partnership between the often - dead composer and the living interpreters is to make sense .

Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying :  Only synchronisation of arms and legs will give symmetry to step and pose ,  strength to the jump ,  speed to the pirouettes  ,  calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance .  To ensure that his <head>audience</head> would appreciate each sentence in his dance , petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times . But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras  so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .  He did this without ever losing sight of the contrasts he made between steps of each sequence because these were controlled by the particular rhythm ,  tempo and quality of the music .

A choreographer working in the classical style is wise to conform to the traditional principles and rules found valuable through years of experience .  They are based on a refinement of the natural movements made by the bones and joints when activated by the muscles ,  tendons and ligaments found in any human body .  The movements were and still are practised because they are designed to display the body as it moves to the best advantage from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . They were and still are designed to give that style of dance spaciousness ,  calm ,  balance and grace of form so that the lines drawn during the transition from one step an/or pose to another fills the available space in every dimension .  In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .

Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the audience ,  because all had to face the king ,  the centre of attention .  The turn of a dancer 's  back can now become part of a beautiful line being made in a total picture .  Today 's dancers not only dance fur an <head>audience</head> . They also dance for and with each other. And it is their response to each other 's  movements and their own enjoyment in dance that makes their behaviour appear natural and spontaneous even when they perform difficult technical feats .

Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .  They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time .  They do it because they know the <head>audience</head> is watching a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement ,  whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as ,  for example ,  in Symphonic Variations  or Requiem  ,  or even just shafts of light as in Monotones  .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to study the historical development of classical style so that they may stage a ballet in a traditional way when it has a story firmly linked to a particular time and place .

They had to adapt their movements to cover a larger space which was like a box with one side only being open to public gaze .  They had to pay greater attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .  Much time was spent in the formulation of rules to lay down the alignments and aulements which would best display each movement from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . These rules still hold good for choreographers who work in the classical medium and the wise ones never neglect them .  If they do ,  their design loses the calm spaciousness which the style demands ,  no matter how fast or slow the dance .

As the thirty - six girls enter one by one down the ramp at the back of the stage and move into six straight lines across the stage until it is completely filled ,  there is one continually progressing line of arabesques  and ports de bras  .  This demonstrates what can be done with two simple movements to hold an <head>audience</head> 's attention . Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,  then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .

His Firebird flew and still flies in all her glory before being trapped pitifully in the arms of the Tsarevich .  Her release sends her soaring in grands jets en avant  through the magic garden .  This flight of the magic bird held and stili holds <head>audiences</head> spellbound . Ashton 's  version of La Fille Mal Garde  is a perfect twentieth - century example of demi - caractre  ballet .  So are de Valois '  The Rake 's  Progress  ,  Cranko 's  Pineapple Poll  and Robbins '  The Concert  .

By so doing he originated a style of dance which owed its liveliness to the way such people behaved and danced in real life .  Even so ,  he did not fully dispense with the technique of the classical school .  He realised , as did later choreographers , that the steps and patterns of such material had to be properly displayed to the <head>audience</head> , not just danced for themselves . In other words he opened up the circles ,  squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .  It is this opening up and exposure of traditional dance that is so important when choreographers attempt to give a realistic atmosphere to the style and expression of their work .

In The Sleeping Beauty  Carabosse shows Aurora what a spindle is for and Aurora later shows how she can use it before she pricks her finger .  In Giselle  ,  Giselle shows Bathilde how she works .  There are many instances of this use of the single gesture for spinning or threading a needle and making a stitch or two which are easily understood and recognised by an <head>audience</head> . A careful study of the gestures of the characters in The  Rake 's  Progress  reveal the trades of the tailor ,  jockey ,  dancing - master ,  gambler and others .  There are many kinds of occupation from which choreographers can and do borrow .

Nineteenth - century choreographers creating either a character or a national ballet used both occupational and natural emotional gesture in their dance designs .  They had to be more specific about the traditionally accepted forms of behaviour ,  customs ,  occupations and particular national characteristics .  It was the impact of the Polovtsian Warriors and their dances from Prince Igor ( 1910 ) that startled Parisian and other <head>audiences</head> into recognition that even the most barbaric dance had a rightful place in the theatre . The differences between character dance and dances of character A distinction must be made between character dance and dances of character .

This English pantomime tradition Ashton also exploited earlier in his choreography for the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella  where he followed the tradition that one is always a somewhat modest violet bossed about by her dragon of a sister .  This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first performances when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann ,  and later the taller MacMillan ,  with wonderfully extended dvelopps  ,  and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs .  A similar incongruous matching of the very tall girl with one of the shortest boys in MacMillan 's Elite Syncopations reveals that he , too , understands that old music - hall and pantomime practices are a wonderful source of inspiration if a British <head>audience</head> is to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancers do . Another commedia dell'arte character whose play has influenced too few choreographers is that of Harlequin ,  a maker of mischief ,  a magicker of spells ,  an animal impersonator and always a great dancer .  Fokine 's  Harlequin only gives a glimpse of his abilities .

Yet the above ballets are different again from de Valois '  The Rake 's  Progress  ,  which was based on the reality of Hogarth 's  pictures .  When these pictures were issued they were indeed contemporary because they were based on the evils of the day .  Today 's <head>audiences</head> find them old - fashioned : yet many modern ballets deal with similar evils such as present - day problems with drugs , AIDS , mental handicap , racism , imprisonment and so on , in which the balletic interpretation makes the same impression if the choreographer has really studied the themes outlined in his subject . These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's  particular behaviour and reactions .  Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock ,  unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's  Progress  and A Distant Drummer  .

By PATRICIA WYNN DAVIES ,  Legal Correspondent BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of <head>audience</head> in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .

In practice ,  initial drafts of rules will be the subject of ongoing discussions between all four parties .  The four will have to have regard to the interest of justice objective .  But on the other hand , the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of <head>audience</head> are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met . A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .  Lord Donaldson 's  formula for settling the rights of audience controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegates .

Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell  ( also the librettist )  ;  and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative audiences ,  it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter .  Two reasons strike me for this .  First , the work is dramaturgically polite ; it consults its <head>audience</head> too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre . And secondly ,  its music is too operatic  too Brittenesque  to excite us searching spirits who trek through gaslit suburbs in quest of aesthetic deprivation .  Like the artists in La Boheme ,  Aggie and Sprugg  Deverell 's  two winos  -  spend a good deal of time play - acting ,  in an operative sort of way .

A part of the myth just did n't work after that .  At their peak in the mid - 60s ,  there were 39 western series on the three American TV networks  almost two a day on each channel .  In the US weekly <head>audience</head> ratings in 1965 , there were three westerns in the top five , and seven in the top 10 . By the mid - 80s they had all gone the way of the buffalo :  extinct save for preservation in the national park of permanent re - runs .  Gene Autry ,  the first TV cowboy ,  now 82 ,  says westerns dominated the early days of TV partly because they had lively ,  cheaply produced visuals ,  but mainly because early TV was starved of feature films by the studios .

'  Within seconds ,  the locals started buying the poets round after round of whisky ,  quoting enthusiastically from MacDiarmid 's  work .  It seems no more than a charming anecdote ,  but when Professor Davie cites Bunting 's  tale in Under Briggflatts ,  his history of British poetry since 1960 ,  he calls the incident challenging .  What prompts him to this unexpected adjective is that ( as Bunting stressed ) the poems these men admired were not simplified to aim at the poor , but written for a hard intellectual <head>audience</head> . But there are further reasons for his choice of qualifier ,  and they involve Davie in cultural as well as literary criticism .  Though its accounts of individual poems are as searching as anything in Davie 's  earlier books  ( we owe Carcanet a debt :  this is to be the first in a uniform edition of Davie 's  work )  ,  Under Briggflatts is also a mordant and compelling history of the social climates to which these poems were a response .

Brown is n't a man with a big punch ;  it 's  those telling body - blows that sap your opponent ,  plus some sly head - butts in the clinch .  Put him in the ring with an audience that you ca n't see ,  and he seems to be delivering butterfly - taps .  The Law Game ( Radio 2 , Tuesday ) also has an <head>audience</head> response problem , perhaps because the format is tired ; after all , it is in its fourteenth series . The way it works is this :  Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows ,  go to industrial tribunals ,  issue death threats and so forth .  If necessary ,  Shaw then adds details  ( who sued whom )  ,  and a panel of celebrities is asked who won and why ,  or who got sent down and for how long .

Well ,  almost every joke :  when celebrity panellist Duggie Brown said backside ,  how they roared !  The flatness is a shame ,  because this is a public service :  you can glean from the programme an idea both of how irrational the law can be ,  and of how flimsy most people 's  understanding of it is .  I had meant to give a detailed critique of the interaction between performers and studio <head>audience</head> in You Asked For It ( Tuesday , Radio 4 ) , a comedy improvisation game produced by the Cardiff Comedy Explosion and introduced by a shy man called Luke Sorba .

By JOHN POPE UNNATURAL troubles ,  in John Pope 's  extraordinary production ,  dominate the stage long before any unnatural deeds by Macbeth himself .  Hecate immediately warns the <head>audience</head> , in a speech displaced to the opening , that it is confronted by a chaotic world in which Scotland does not even stand where it did . Some Armageddon has wiped away landscape and locale ,  leaving only a hurricane - stricken desolation ,  blasted by a huge wind - machine on the stage .

Limited scope exists for actors to develop individual characters :  there is little room ,  in particular ,  to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that Macbeth 's  conflicts can elicit in an audience .  Any loss in emotional or dramatic range ,  however ,  is generally compensated for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that results ,  and the compelling stylishness with which it is communicated .  Moving , like the witches , with confident , implacable force , the Citizens ' creates a Macbeth machine to assault a Scottish <head>audience</head> 's expectations of this most familiar of Shakespeare 's plays , leaving it , by the end , thoroughly drained and disturbed .

Strictly speaking ,  this last description is accurate .  The conductor 's  role ,  after all ,  is silent .  The <head>audience</head> sits mesmerised by his expressive choreography , watching each inflection of the hand or eyebrow . We almost convince ourselves that the music is created not by the orchestra but by the tip of the baton itself ,  rich sounds oozing out like some exotic genie .

Avuncular and sociable ,  he was a warm and friendly person who might be encountered conducting a Women 's  Institute choir ,  accompanying an audition at the piano ,  as a freelance organist or providing harpsichord continuo .  As a bass ,  his appearances in the choir at the Three Choirs Festivals found a singer who could really get the bottom notes .  By the wider public he will be remembered as a composer whose style , founded in practical music - making , has an immediate appeal which rewards both performers and <head>audiences</head> . He more or less started the Gloucester County Youth Orchestra ,  which he conducted for 13 years ,  as well as running the County Music Summer Schools .  These activities gave him an enduring influence in the development of young musicians .

The format of the traditional choral suite with soloist is also reflected in the light - hearted Good Company for baritone ,  chorus and orchestra  ( 1964 )  ,  and later in The Celestial City written for Adrian Beaumont and the Bristol Bach Choir in 1977 .  Hewitt - Jones also wrote orchestral music ,  including a Sinfonietta for Strings  ( 1959 )  ,  concertos for oboe ,  for clarinet and for trumpet  ( 1966 ,  1968 ,  1976 )  ,  the first and last being works of considerable substance and worthwhile additions to somewhat restricted repertoires .  While not primarily a composer of chamber music , his substantial Piano Trio performed by the Joubert Trio in 1985 , would appeal to a wide <head>audience</head> . The majority of his music was written for particular occasions ,  for performers known to him or in memory of friends and colleagues .  Possibly the best known of these is the Mass of Reconciliation written for Coventry 25 years after the bombing  ( a service which appeared on disc )  ,  and his association with the Three Choirs Festival which included his Te Deum in 1962 ,  his setting of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men at the opening service in 1977 ,  and the Benedicite  ( in memory of Cecil Adams )  in 1986 .

His own contribution was sober and only occasionally spiced with alternative wit .  There was no attempt to liken any Conservative minister ,  or downtrodden Chancellor ,  to Baldrick or anyone else .  But his mere appearance ensured a packed <head>audience</head> , eager for anything approaching intentional humour at their party conference . In this respect ,  Kenneth Baker 's  jocular early reference to Labour 's  Gould mine of political gaffes may conceivably have fallen a little short .  Only the organist in the conference hall seemed to be properly tuned - in ,  belting out a rendition of Bewitched ,  bothered and bewildered as the representatives filed in for their annual law and order debate .

Yet subsequent projects revealed an almost unerring instinct for commercial blackspots .  The album of music for the film Mike 's  Murder was left looking limp after John Barry had been hired ,  at the last minute ,  to replace sizeable parts of Jackson 's  score on the actual soundtrack .  Then there was the three - sided live LP , Big World ( 1986 ) , during the recording of which the <head>audience</head> was asked to observe silence . And the accounts department at AM probably stopped short of throwing a party when Jackson delivered the tapes for 1987 's  Will Power ,  an orchestral instrumental album .

It seemed to be genuine .  The speaker who complained at the burden on small businesses was clapped by just a handful .  For lengthy passages of the Chancellor 's speech , while Mr Lawson addressed his wider <head>audience</head> in the City and the country at large , their on - cue responses seemed more mechanical than enthusiastic . The acclaim was loudest ,  and most heartfelt ,  when Mr Lawson derided the inability of the Opposition to offer a convincing alternative formula .  Outside ,  Tory representatives were ambushed by camera crews and reporters ,  and nearly all strove to re - echo Mr Lawson 's  message in fulsome terms .

By STEPHEN GOODWIN LABOUR'S new arms policy was condemned by Tom King yesterday as an appalling shambles which would cripple Britain 's  conventional forces ,  scrub nuclear weapons and leave the country well and truly defenceless .  The Secretary of State for Defence roused his <head>audience</head> with a fierce attack on Labour over its Brighton conference decisions on defence and the appearance at a fringe meeting there of Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein leader . The country should recognise what some members of the new model Labour party were like ,  Mr King said .  They are the ones who invited Mr Adams to address them just 500 yards from the Grand Hotel which some of us have cause to remember ;  to address them less than two weeks after the time when ,  along the coast at Deal ,  10 young musicians in the Royal Marines were foully murdered .

The speech consisted of little more than bullish assertions of the underlying dynamism and strength of the British economy .  When the final draft was completed ,  shortly after midnight in his suite at the Imperial Hotel ,  it was made known that he would have nothing to say to markets on this occasion .  His sole purpose was to defend his stewardship and reaffirm his policy before the <head>audience</head> of the loyal in the ballroom of the Winter Gardens . If he has other things to say they will be said at Mansion House next Thursday ,  an occasion by tradition for the Chancellor to speak on monetary policy .  Glaringly absent from yesterday 's  speech were any mention of the balance of payments ,  the recent excitement on the money markets ,  exchange rate policy or the European Monetary System .

The same has happened at the Department of the Environment :  Christopher Patten has conducted himself this week as the antithesis of an ideologue .  No such retreat exists with the economy  ( though Mr Lawson did abandon pure monetarism )  .  Ministers can merely attack the Labour Party : the only passage in Mr Lawson 's speech on Thursday which moved his <head>audience</head> to genuine enthusiasm was his attack on Neil Kinnock . Labour is ,  however ,  becoming a less vulnerable target .  To deride the party 's  mass conversion from its former belief ,  as Mrs Thatcher did yesterday ,  raises a cheer from committed Conservatives ,  but floating voters may reckon that it is intelligent to abandon wrong - headed policies .

The only area an exile hopes to cultivate is what the Americans call the chicken and peas circuit  those endless dinners ,  lunches and buffet suppers by which the Conservative Party binds its supporters in a form of social cement out in the sticks .  By now Heseltine has probably got about as much mileage out of such occasions as he can reasonably expect .  He has certainly demonstrated that he is a draw : there must already be some 250 Conservative MPs in his debt for turning out an <head>audience</head> at least double that which they would otherwise have been able to collect . Part of the Heseltine strategy is ,  no doubt ,  based on the calculation that these debts one day can be collected  and certainly ,  within the Conservative Party 's  electoral college of MPs ,  he ought to have established some impressive lines of credit .  It is a nave aspirant party leader ,  though ,  who pins his faith to gratitude .

This knowledge is also recursive ,  in that the competent policeman or woman needs to know which criminals have a common - sense knowledge about the activities and deployment of the police ,  which requires that they have the additional common sense to confound the criminal 's  working knowledge of the police .  Hence a policeman is only as good as his interest in his and surrounding areas  ( FN 30/11/87 ,  p. 28 )  .  The field - worker was a captive <head>audience</head> to whom members of the force could display their competence when riding around Easton in a police vehicle , and conversations were punctuated by policemen pointing out significant sites and personnel . So ,  too ,  were new recruits and staff transferred from outside the area .  However ,  the dissemination of this knowledge to newcomers has the additional purpose of inculcating in them the common sense that is necessary to police Easton .

Different elements of the media perform different functions .

If they have any influence at all , different media sources should influence their <head>audiences</head> in different ways . THE EXPECTED INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION Television news has three significant characteristics that affect its ability to influence the electorate .

We need to distinguish between different elements of the media ,  and between the media 's  ability to inform and its ability to persuade .  In this chapter we have looked at influences on public perceptions of politics ,  not at influences upon attitudes .  From what we already knew about its <head>audiences</head> and programme content , we expected that television would have a stronger influence on public information and perceptions than on public attitudes and choices ; while the press , particularly the mass - selling tabloids , would have a stronger influence on public attitudes and choices than on public information and perceptions . Television news was pervasive ,  undifferentiated ,  and relatively unbiased .  It proved immensely effective at communicating party campaign themes to the electorate ,  but in the short span of an election campaign it had only a small influence on the public 's  issue - agenda .

Public perceptions that the election was increasingly a two - horse race matched trends in published opinion polls but preceded television 's  switch towards marginalizing the Alliance by focusing on two - party controversy .  Except in so far as they publicized opinion poll findings ,  television projections of party credibility did not dictate public perceptions .  In contrast to television , the press was highly differentiated : different papers reached very different <head>audiences</head> with very different messages . While the pervasiveness and uniformity of television news made it unlikely that it would influence different people in different ways ,  the press seemed likely to influence different readers in very different ways .  Since political bias was so much a characteristic of the press we might expect its influence to be more apparent in terms of attitudes than perceptions ,  however .

While new technology has reduced the costs of entry into newspaper publishing ,  its main effect has been to improve the profitability of established press barons .  The range of newspapers read by the bulk of the British electorate has narrowed sharply over the last two decades  in terms of the political partisanship of mass - selling papers ,  if not in terms of the proliferation of low - circulation titles  ( Newton ,  1988a ,  p. 320 ;  Tunstall ,  1983 ,  p. 12 )  .  Indeed , with the exception of Atlanta 's Cable News Network , seen by a very small <head>audience</head> in Britain , even the introduction of new television technology has so far only extended the reach ( if not the profitability ) of Britain 's existing press barons . Of course ,  it can be argued that readers get the paper that they want or deserve .  As Whale  ( 1977 ,  p. 84 )  argues :  It is readers who determine the character of newspapers .

Highbrow television ,  however ,  reached the politically interested almost irrespective of their  education level .  These variations in media use suggest that radio and the press provide a choice of detail which matches the demands of different sectors of the public  in keeping with the Libertarian Ideal .  At the same time the <head>audience</head> pattern for highbrow television news seems more in keeping with the Public Service Ideal : reaching out to the interested public irrespective of social background . There was much less choice in terms of the media 's  political partisanship .  Only the Guardian  amongst the qualities and the Mirror   ( with its Scottish stable - mate ,  the Record )  amongst the tabloids could be considered even moderately left - wing in 1987 .

He had one side of him ,  in those days ,  which suspected modern science because of its part in the process of industrialization ,  and its philistine attitude ,  as he supposed ,  to literature .  He bewildered his <head>audience</head> for a moment , and then moved them , when he suddenly turned a political invective about government 's neglect of the environment into a lament that one of the sad losses was going to be the poetry of the countryside , the pastorals of a Vergil or a Theocritus .

Player power is once more causing concern amongst those responsible for administering tennis throughout the world .  Even the players themselves are getting concerned although they put it in slightly different terms .  Boris Becker recently expressed the view that there was too much money in tennis and that it was ruining the game a view of course that it is much easier to make objectively once you have 5m in the <head>bank</head> . It is ,  of course ,  money that causes almost all the trouble .  It is at the root of almost all the player power problems .

In junction box  wiring ,  the lighting cable goes from the consumer unit to a series of four - terminal junction boxes ,  each usually positioned roughly over the appropriate light switch ;  cables lead from each junction box to a ceiling rose and to the switch .

Loop - in wiring is more straightforward to do ,  but junction box wiring is a better system for light fittings  ( other than simple pendant lights )  and is easier to add to .  With either system ,  the easiest place to add is the last light in the circuit ,  which is often the hall or landing light .

A good working knowledge of the Building Regulations requirements is therefore necessary .  The council is also empowered to ask for details of any unusual part of the project to prove compliance with the Building Regulations ,  eg special foundations for building on doubtful ground .  Another disadvantage of the Building Notice procedure is that if your work is to be financed by a <head>bank</head> or building society , then you may be required to produce some form of documentary proof that your proposal is satisfactory when you are negotiating for your loan . Your council will only provide a Building Regulations Approval Notice when Full Plans are deposited ,  so you will have to use this method .  The Building Notice is most suited for minor jobs associated with dwellings .

Crisis and clarity are notebook froth whipped up by a single hidden energy .  I ask ,  what does Dostoevsky 's  gambling  mania aspire towards ?  And I answer , breaking the <head>bank</head> of all banks , busting Plato 's very Idea of a bank ; and also being cleaned out absolutely but absolutely : body , mind , immortal soul : in fact the Dostoevsky apocalypse where all shall be revealed , where crisis is clarity . And obviously the novelist 's  apocalypse is by no means identical with his received Christian one ;  hence ,  in part ,  the divergence of his art from the things his notebooks show him wanting to say .  It 's  a reflection on sadomasochism ,  and on negation ,  and on the Underground throughout these novels ,  that the true gambler 's  urge to lose is as strong as and not ultimately separable from its opposite .

The <head>banks</head> financing the huge project have given Eurotunnel until the end of the year to come up with an agreed costing for completion of the tunnel sufficient to enable them to release fresh loans . Their technical advisers ,  the American engineering consultancy Parsons de Leuw Cather and the German consultancy Lahmeyer International ,  estimate the cost of the project now at 8.1bn .  Eurotunnel ,  which is already in default of its credit agreement with the synidcate of 200 banks ,  is seeking an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn on top of the 6bn raised so far .

By the close ,  the shares had fallen a further 40p on the London market to close at 560p while they ended the day on the French bourse Fr3.6 lower at Fr59.9 amid heavy dealing in both markets .  As the shares continued to fall in the wake of Eurotunnel 's estimate that the project would cost at least 2.2bn more than forecast , Alastair Morton , co - chairman of the Anglo - French consortium was in Paris trying to persuade the French <head>banks</head> of the need for new financing .

The fact that traffic estimates are not being increased to compensate for the rising construction costs is certain to raise fears that the cost of using the tunnel will be forced up by its scheduled opening in June 1993 .  Mr Morton is certain to face a City grilling on the latest cost and traffic estimates when Eurotunnel presents its interim results next Monday .

By MICHAEL PREST INTEREST rates obediently rose accross Europe yesterday after the Bundesbank ,  the West German central bank ,  increased its lending rates by one percentage point and its counterparts participated in a co - ordinated attempt to suppress the dollar and maintain exchange rate parities within the European Monetary System .

But the carefully prepared general rise in European interest rates immediately prompted concern that it represented German worries about domestic inflation and the ability of the Bundesbank to persuade other countries to follow its policy ,  rather than an expression of the determination of the Group of Seven ,  the leading industrial nations ,  to control the dollar .  Neither the US nor Japan raised its rates .

This research influences the way volunteers work with victims but it is also passed on by Victim Support to other organisations that might find it useful :  it provides an input into every police training course in Britain ,  and that has led to a potential new area of work .  Former police officers now doing security jobs in shops , <head>banks</head> and offices have begun to ask Victim Support to provide help for employees who have become victims of crime through robberies or other incidents at the workplace . Next year ,  Victim Support will be publishing reports on projects covering child victims of crime ,  families of murder victims ,  racial harassment and high crime areas .  In January ,  it will launch a new court service ,  based on seven Crown courts in England ,  designed to establish the needs of victims and witnesses attending court .

Rugby League :  Canberra 's  capital gain By PAUL WILSON CANBERRA RAIDERS flew home via Honolulu last night with their pride dented but their <head>bank</head> balance improved by 60,000 , the amount both they and Widnes cleared from the World Club Challenge match . On financial grounds alone the event was a resounding success ,  and after two thrilling encounters in the last two years the public appetite here is established beyond doubt .  The future of the fixture depends on the commitment of the Australians ,  however ,  and after two consecutive defeats ,  the enthusiasm for the World Club Challenge Down Under is more difficult to gauge .

Rates at the current 7.5 to 8 per cent make cash a much better alternative than it was before .  Higher European interest rates were hardly the main concern of investors in Oslo ,  home of Europe 's  second - best performing market this year .  Norwegian investors were surprised on Thursday by the suspension of the shares of Den norske Creditbank ( DnC ) and Bergen Bank on the news of a proposed merger between the two to form Norway 's largest <head>bank</head> . The other interesting news was Norsk Hydro 's  announcement that it planned to buy DnC 's  9 per cent stake in Saga Petroleum .  Reactions to the merger have been decidedly mixed in Oslo .

A more positive view of the merger is that consolidation in the fragmented Norwegian banking sector is a necessity and balance sheets need to be strengthened .  DnC 's  worse - than - expected results are indicators that the Norwegian banking sector ,  if perhaps on the road to recovery ,  is not all well yet .  Norwegian <head>banks</head> were severely hit by the 1986 oil price fall . On top of that the 1987 stock market crash and a steep domestic increase in interest rates nearly nearly put paid to some of them  including DnC .  The fact that the loan losses of the banks remain heavy will force the Norwegian government to agree to the merger which otherwise might not square with its normally tough monopoly considerations .

But under the US system ,  banks stand a much greater chance of actually retaining them .  On a five - year conventional Eurobond ,  fees might be 1.25 per cent of the total issue amount ,  yet banks would be lucky to see one eighth per cent  ( and that on a good deal )  once discounts had been allowed to buyers of the bonds .  On a similar US - style deal , commissions might be only 0.325 per cent but most of that should end up with the <head>banks</head> . Which brings us to the blockbusting Italy issue arranged by Morgan Stanley ,  the US investment bank which put together the first US - style issue in Europe with an offering for New Zealand in August .  Bankers had expected that the fees for the Italy deal would be the standard 0.325 per cent .

Bankers had expected that the fees for the Italy deal would be the standard 0.325 per cent .  According to reliable sources ,  however ,  Italy is paying only 0.25 per cent to its underwriters .  Bankers close to the deal say that Morgan Stanley was forced reluctantly to accept a lower commission structure because Italy was being offered this by other <head>banks</head> competing for the business . The fear now is that banks will start to compete by driving commission rates lower and lower until they are prepared to arrange issues at break - even or worse .  And this would vindicate those who believe that the market 's  ills are not going to be solved by tinkering with new issue processes ,  but rather by a drastic cutback in the overheads  ie ,  sacking people  being carried by the industry .

They cannot be expected to consider the inflationary consequences of their commercial activities .

The Savings and Investment Bank ,  said to be owned by property developer Victor Gray ,  closed its doors in July 1982 having given massive loan facilities .  One of these was said to be a 5m loan to Raper 's  master company ,  the Hong Kong and Netherlands based Gasco Group .  This was given nine months before the <head>bank</head> collapsed and financed Gasco 's takeover of Cornish tin mining company St Piran . When the bank went into liquidation repayment was demanded and Raper immediately started a 15m action for damages ,  saying it was being called in earlier than agreed .  A long - running legal wrangle ensued with Gasco assets ultimately being frozen and a court undertaking secured from St Piran not to reduce its UK assets below 7m ,  sufficient to cover the SIB claim .

His clients had pressed ahead with the claim against his companies and Mr Ashton told the Manx judge ,  John Corrin ,  that the matter had been settled out of court and Raper was prepared to admit judgment for 11.7m ,  which would be paid into a firm of local advocates .  This ,  he said ,  would clear the way for an interim repayment to the depositors ,  and although there were some small administration problems ,  he saw no reason why this should not be done in the near future .  He said that although Raper and his henchman , Allen , had unlawfully exported large sums of money out of the UK 's jurisdiction , by the terms of the agreement the <head>bank</head> liquidators would take no voluntary part in any subsequent proceedings relating to the contempt charges . After the judgment ,  Mr Ashton was approached by a group of irate depositors and questioned about the return of their money .  He told them that around 10m of the lost cash had been recovered and a payment of this would be made .

At these levels ,  borrowers with savings or investments must be wondering whether it is worthwhile using some of their cash to pay off the mortgage in part or in full .  The net cost of borrowing for those with loans of 30,000 or less works out at 10.87 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer ,  8.7 per cent for those paying tax at 40 per cent .  With a net return of 12 per cent easily attainable from building society and <head>bank</head> high interest accounts , it is still cheaper to borrow and keep your savings on deposit . But for those with loans over 30,000 where there is no tax relief ,  it is certainly worth considering paying off some of the mortgage  -  particularly since there is no clear indication of when rates might come down. But if it is bad news for borrowers ,  investors have never had it so good .

Bank upon <head>bank</head> of thrift and proud long - stemmed daisies intermingled with huge expanses of gorse and foxgloves . It was a spectacular sight  the best I 've had of wild flowers in Britain .  There were also remnants of late bluebells which were well past their best but must have been magnificent in spring .

He began to make a collection of brass rubbings .   REPTON Repton was an Anglo - Saxon town , on the south <head>bank</head> of the River Trent , and was at one time a chief city of the Kingdom of Mercia . Saxon remains could still be found among the buildings ,  there is a Saxon crypt to the church ,  and the setting is hauntingly beautiful .  It was one of the schools that came out of the Reformation ,  for it was founded during the reign of Queen Mary by a landowner who sat for Derbyshire in Parliament .

This seems to me to illustrate what I would call the Breakthrough Phenomenon :  the sudden discovery that something which has been assumed to be out of the question is not out of the question at all .  Unless my recollection is at fault ,  it seems to be that two generations ago it was accepted in our society that we did not use firearms .  There was no more objective reason why firearms should not have been used in burglaries and <head>bank</head> hold - ups thirty or sixty years ago than today ; but it was n't done until it was discovered that it was done , that you could do it . There was never any problem in getting hold of the firearms ;  but nobody wanted to get hold of them ,  because it was not done to use firearms .  Then ,  after a bit ,  it becomes not something unacceptable ,  but something accepted or at least something which is demonstrated to be not out of the question .

Instead , he was living in a north London flat and working weekdays in a City <head>bank</head> , returning home at night to a difficult marriage . London itself ,  however ,  may have furnished encouragement for the lines Eliot 's  thought was taking .

It was rather a more specific and harsher problem which ,  to put it bluntly ,  was to survive as Westland was drifting on to the rocks of insolvency .  We knew in 1985 that when we made our preliminary announcement of our results for the previous financial year that we would become technically insolvent .  So the main thrust of all one 's efforts was to try and save the company as a corporate entity and secure the interests of the employees , the shareholders and the <head>banks</head> . Confining his attention to private - sector issues ,  Cuckney was in no doubt about what his priorities were .

I had ,  as it happens ,  had experience just before Westland of another very well - known public company  John Brown  which had encountered difficulties .  As chairman ,  I had been involved in its capital reconstruction and ultimate sale to  Trafalgar House. What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the <head>banks</head> and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation , which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier . It was in fact my experience of working with the banks and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .  The institutions and banks had been immensely supportive in helping save the company .

It is a living example which shows that the accusations of short - termism levelled against the City are really not valid  certainly in this respect .

Between 1960 and 1980 the total acreage devoted to food production in Africa increased from about 70 million hectares to about 100 million ,  or about 2.5 per cent per year ,  sufficient to sustain a population increase of about 2.7 per cent .  Yet during the same period the acreage devoted to export crops grew from only 15.5 million hectares to 17.2 million ;  of the seven major export crops the production volume of only three :  tea ,  cotton and tobacco ,  increased .  Livestock owners continued to manage their herds primarily as a means of survival and a <head>bank</head> of wealth rather than to maximize the number of animals they marketed . Africa 's  trade in cereals was seriously skewed .  She might ,  as in 19867 ,  have to import 8 million tonnes of cereals ,  amounting to about 40 per cent of urban consumption ,  or ,  as in 1988/9 have a surplus of 3 million tonnes which could not be transported ,  and thus sold ,  to deficit countries .

As each group of rigs arrived they moved quietly on to the sloping cobbled ramp ,  which in times past had been used by a civilian ferry ,  and with a hiss of hydraulics opened out .  The crew ,  moving rapidly yet almost soundlessly ,  carried out the few jobs required to convert the land vehicle to a boat ,  and within seconds the rigs slid rapidly into the dark water and powered away to swing out  their ramps and couple together in twos and threes .  Simultaneously the men of the <head>bank</head> support section tugged and pulled their steel wire ropes and tirfor winches into place , to provide anchorages from which to hold the ends of the bridge in the correct depth of water for loading . Within a few minutes all the rigs had arrived and splashed in ,  and the earlier arrivals which had formed two -  and three - rig rafts were crabbing across the river and pushing upstream to the bridge centreline .  The crane ratchets of the later arrivals could still be heard clearly as their crews outramped ,  and rising bow waves could be spotted as an occasional laggard powered upstream to its proper place in the echelon .

Both the two - rig landing bays had moved into the banks on the centreline ,  and their combined crews ,  assisted by the ubiquitous bank support section ,  had connected the anchor ropes and the short ramp sections ,  Which were added to the main ramps to allow traffic easy access to the bridge .  The Troop Staff Sergeant detailed to supervise the construction was insistently calling the rafts into the head of the bridge ,  where they coupled on with remarkable rapidity .  The end of the bridge was clearly visible as it grew out of the far <head>bank</head> , and needed only a couple of rafts to make it complete . At that moment the men detailed as River Watchers radioed that a fast - moving vessel was coming downstream ,  and the Safety Officer ,  not at all sure of the newcomer 's  identity or intentions ,  fired an illuminating parachute flare over the nearly complete bridge to warn of the obstruction across its bows .  The Wasserschutz Polizei ,   or River Police launch ,  Whose arrival had been expected much earlier ,  turned on its blue flashing light and jauntily turned to take station upstream ,  in order to intercept any barge or ship choosing to ignore the river closure order which had been imposed by the river authorities for the night .

A few last checks by the Bridge Commander ,  and it was declared ready for traffic ,  seven minutes ahead of time .  The first vehicles loomed out of the darkness on the south <head>bank</head> , driving only on convoy lights with each one following the barely seen , under - chassis - mounted , single White light of the one in front . Rig Commanders stationed on the inshore ramp guided the drivers on with brief flashes of their green lights ,  and the convoy drove steadily across .  The bridge was held against the current by the engine power of twenty - eight port engines ,  finely adjusted by the pilots on their stands above the rig cabs .

Amnesty groups '  work responded to the challenge with new techniques such as networks focusing on abuses in specific areas of the world and campaigns on whole countries or themes .  For example ,  a Murder by Governments Campaign in October 1983 resulted in funeral marches with black coffins ,  drumbeats ,  and candles in Diss ,  Norwich ,  Bognor Regis ,  and London .  How to find the money necessary to carry out Amnesty 's work has always been a worry , and from the very <head>beginning</head> the Section Office asked groups for help in this area . However ,  in the first few years groups did not appear to consider fundraising a priority .

If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .  Some of the main efforts of historians in the first decades of the twentieth century had been directed to putting order into a mass of material ,  analysing works and documents ,  and establishing historical data .  German art historians had <head>begun</head> much more systematically on this task than others . Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information ,  which became standard works .  Histories of art appeared in sequences of volumes by different authors ,  there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections ,  besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 .

This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear .  Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about different aspects of the past ,  such as social conditions .  Deciding where is the <head>beginning</head> can be a trouble for an art historian . In Europe ,  classical times are a beginning for historians ,  but not for archaeologists .  For some art historians ,  the Renaissance is a new beginning ,  though medievalists can point out convincingly that no one event divides the Middle Ages from the Renaissance .

But now I want to win and win and win .  ,  Salim ,  too ,  wants to win ,  and his affair with Yvette is a victory :  All my energy and mind were devoted to that new end of winning the person .  In possessing her ,  he is both taken out of ,  and placed in possession of ,  himself :  She gave me the idea of my manliness I had grown to need .  When the friendship <head>begins</head> to fail , he says : What she drew out of me remained extraordinary to me . The affair seems to him to belong to the town ,  to have no future ,  and they are parted when the town comes under fear and hazard .  He finds himself considering the idea of flight ,  and the idea of defeat :  1 suppose that ,  thinking of my own harassment and Raymond 's  defeat ,  I had begun to consider Yvette a defeated person as well ,  trapped in the town ,  as sick of herself and the wasting asset of her body as I was sick of myself and my anxieties .

The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .  She <head>begins</head> by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about difficulties encountered in his private life a remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women , followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other , followed by but that would be wrong , would n't it ? And she notes that the same remark ,  or the same sentences ,  can be found in Amis 's  novel .  What interests her ,  apparently ,  is not the remark itself ,  but the degree to which the piece of recall  her piece of recall ,  presumably  failed to affect the novel in any way .

The prevailing protestant  loyalist beliefs stress the existence of the people of Northern Ireland ,  who are distinguished by their Ulster protestantism and democratic values ,  and by their claim to a flexible territory of Ulster .  Despite some socialist groups within the alliance ,  the dominant economic belief is capitalist .  A further central belief has recently <head>begun</head> to appear as equivocal , namely loyalism itself . Related to this is the final principal belief element ,  the conviction of the legitimacy of force in maintaining the subordination of catholic nationalists within the statelet .  A fuller account of these two groups of dominant beliefs benefits from some comparison between the two .

The importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimated given the extent of religious practice and the power of religious men within the protestant  loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's  position as absolutely irreproachable ,  depending as it does on a divine source .  At the heart ,  or within the innermost wall of the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  is the man of God  not woman ,  not rough ,  and not immoral  be he soldier ,  clergyman ,  businessman ,  or farmer .

In the Roman catholic account ,  Christ appoints Peter to lead the church he has founded .  In the other ,  the church is founded but taken over early on by the Popes in Rome and by priests who use magic and ritual to gain control of God 's   people ,  thus profaning his divine word .

But secularizing moves by the English liberals  over the Education Bills of 1902 ,  1906 ,  and a private member 's  Bill of 1911  led the Irish hierarchy to question some of the political intentions of the Irish politicians ,  who it was feared might sell out the church 's  interest in schools .  According to the Liberal - Irish alliance ,  the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill ,  aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control :  that is ,  giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .  With the Irish party abstaining , both English and Irish Roman catholic bishops <head>began</head> to pressurize the leader of the Irish party , Redmond , and his associates to support the Conservative bill . Added upset came in the same year from a speech by Dr W. Starkie ,  the commissioner of National Education in Ireland ,  who attacked school managers for not being up to their job .  The attack was within the context of a speech largely praising the Roman catholic church in Ireland .

Much worse to begin too soon and realize one is inadequately prepared than to begin too late and realize one is over - prepared .

Wine ,  at its simplest ,  means crushing grapes and letting the wild yeasts on the  the  skins ferment the sweet juices into alcohol .

When barley is harvested it is taken to a maltings where the grains are soaked in water to encourage germination .

As the roots <head>begin</head> to break out of the grains the barley is transferred to a vast hall heated with warm air and turned by large malt shovels . When the maltster is satisfied that germination has unlocked the rich natural sugars in the barley ,  the grains are taken to a kiln room where heat stops germination .  The temperature of the kilning process determines the type of malt produced :  the higher the temperature the darker the malt .

Caramel is sometimes added to give darker colouring to the finished beer .

The finings attract yeast and other particles and <head>begin</head> to drag them to the bottom of the tank . Now the beer is ready for the final stage in the brewery before it leaves for the pub cellar .  It is run or racked into casks ,  made either of wood or metal ,  sometimes with some priming sugar and a handful of dry hops :  the sugar will encourage a vigorous secondary fermentation in the cask and the hops will add a delightful aroma .

The ritual of the whitewashing  ( or limewashing ,  as Harry calls it )  the houses was in itself a method of pest control .  The lime was mixed with flowers of sulphur so that the walls would give off sulphurous fumes when they got warm .  Limewashing <head>began</head> in October and all the houses had to be finished by the end of February , as many would then have the heat turned up to set their inmates into growth . It was also during the winter months that vines were taken down from their wires and their ends tied  ( often to the water pipes )  so that they formed a large bow shape .  This checked the sap and induced even growth .

A rapid winch launch will tend to pitch the glider back on to the tail ,  making a larger forward movement necessary to get the tail off the ground and so ensure a margin of speed when the aircraft takes off .  With all types of glider ,  it is wise to hold the stick right forward for the initial part of the ground run ,  so that there is no possibility of the glider zooming off the ground and into a steep climb if the winch driver applies full power too quickly .  However , as soon as it <head>begins</head> to accelerate smoothly , that movement is no longer necessary , and the control should be moved to get the glider balanced nicely on to the main wheel . Care must be taken not to keep the stick  forward for too long ,  as too much forward movement during the take - off run will prevent the glider from leaving the ground until a much higher speed is reached .  It is also undesirable because ,  if the glider is bounced off by bumpy ground ,  it will fly back into the ground heavily a few moments later .

Then , and only then , <head>begin</head> the side - slip and use up sufficient height to be sure that full airbrake will be more than adequate to get down for a spot landing . With most gliders the attitude for the nose during the slip needs to be no higher than required to maintain the chosen approach speed .

No one brought up in the Jewish faith with his sort of European connections could fail to be unaware ,  or convulsed ,  by the nightmare we call the Holocaust .  Nightmares and night - time anxiety ,  are a regular feature of Leonard 's  work ,  though he did remark to us ,  I do n't think  that I was scarred by anything .

Night itself occurs several times in his early books of poetry ,  as it was bound to do ,  and its references are of an intimidating sort :  the night never ending  ( in Letter )  ,  and the clinic of your thighs against the night  ( in Let Us Compare Mythologies  ;  the latter intimating that other experience of the night which such high thinkers as Bertrand Russell found laden with sexual feelings )  .

More recently ,  and perhaps begging the question of its mental significance ,  it has come to be known as the Readiness Potential  ( RP )  .

Averaging the EEG over forty such self - initiated movements , Libet found that there was indeed a time - locked negative shift <head>beginning</head> about 550 msec before the movement . Whatever the particular significance of these RPs in terms of information processing ,  it is reasonable to conclude with Libet that 550 msec is the minimum interval by which neural activity precedes a self - initiated ,  and therefore presumably voluntary ,  movement .  At the same time ,  Libet set up a procedure for allowing subjects to report the time at which they first experienced the conscious intention to act .

If the acceleration is healthy ,  the change into the climb can be made normally ;  if the acceleration is slower than normal ,  then of course the climb must be restricted .  At all times the angle of climb and the combination of speed and height must be such that a safe recovery can be made if the launch fails .  When the change in angle is made smoothly , the glider will be <head>climbing</head> at a safe angle and will be able to recover if there is a launch failure at any point . Students used to be told that it was dangerous to steepen the climb below 100 feet .  This made them hold the glider down and often caused overspeeding or even overrunning of the cable or parachute .

With a low - powered winch or tow car ,  the acceleration is far slower and there is plenty of time to get the glider nicely balanced on the wheel so that it leaves the ground with a safe margin of speed .

If they are recognised ,  there is almost always plenty of time to prevent a stall occurring .  However ,  many inexperienced pilots get so thoroughly engrossed in the thermalling or what is going on elsewhere that they are temporarily switched off to how they are flying .  Perhaps the work - load is high at the time , looking at the map and the ground for possible clues as to where they are , looking for signs of possible lift to <head>climb</head> in , together with all the other little worries involved in a field landing . It is often at these times that the glider becomes stalled without the pilot noticing ,  and then his instincts are bound to be automatic as the nose and wing drops .  If you stall accidentally it is almost always because you are not aware of the low speed ,  etc. and therefore all the training in the world will not prevent you from responding instinctively because you are not at that moment aware that you are stalled .

But it is the glider pilot who literally has the life of the tow pilot in his hands .  Remember ,  do not hold the glider down too close to the ground ,  5 to 10 feet is safer .  Be ready to ease up to stay in position as the tug starts to <head>climb</head> . If you get out of position and if you find yourself too low ,  move up slowly in small steps ,  checking the movement every few feet .  Don't try to move to the correct position too quickly .

Remember ,  thermal soaring is more about staying in the strongest area of lift than flying at an efficient angle of bank ;  it usually pays to turn  steeply ,  as the small turning circle enables you to keep in the narrow cores of strong lift .  If flying across country is not practical and you are local soaring ,  it is better to practise moving from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without taking the climbs to any great height .  For example , on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base , <head>climb</head> to 2500 feet on the first climb , then fly off leaving that thermal , using the airbrakes if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 feet . If you are aiming to go back for a landing ,  only stay long enough in that thermal to get properly centred before moving off again down to 1500 feet and starting to look for the next bit of lift .  Bring each search a little lower .

The opening ceremony ,  set for last May ,  was cancelled ,  and local activists had to remain on the original walls while gazing up in wonder at the spectacular treat they were being denied .  The irony being , of course , that <head>climbing</head> on the new wall would be considerably safer than soloing on the existing facilities .

Undaunted ,  he returned a week later and made the first clean ascent .  In fact The Crack is a much more interesting climb than the name would suggest .  At least a third of the route takes the steep open wall to the left of the corner and the climb as a whole demands a wide range of <head>climbing</head> technique . Even the first pitch ,  escaping left from the steep corner ,  demands positive commitment and the ability to confidently tackle technical wall climbing .  The next pitch ,  stepping from the exposed top of the pinnacle block ,  is again a bold exercise ,  one immediately followed by a forced mantleshelf move to gain a horizontal weakness in the smooth wall .

Our first encounter with The way through the Fish ,  a modern classic of the Marmalada South Face in the Italian Dolomites had ended with us well beaten and rather incomprehendingly abseiling down during a perfect alpine evening .

Yes , we had clearly failed on a hard pitch , but that bulging wall above , rising blank and massive into the sky , surely could n't be <head>climbed</head> at the grade given in the guide ? It was a wall straight out of Verdon ,  with the same perfect grey rock ,  interspersed with pockets .  But unlike the modern crags ,  this wall had no bolts and the major difficulties ended only after pitch 23 .

And what if we were caught in the exit chimneys in a storm like the one the day before ,  stranded without head torches ?

The season ticket agreement John Horscroft and Pat Shilland hope climbers will avidly welcome ever more firmly establishes that climbers should be asked to pay for their climbing .  To the casual or occasional visitor to High Rocks ,  the season ticket agreement may seem irrelevant at the moment  just something to please climbers living nearby who go there regularly .  But given the discrimination shown against climbers in the present price structure , how long might it be before you <head>climb</head> at High Rocks by season ticket , or prior arrangement and private fee only ? No ,  this arrangement does climbers no favours .  Given the delicate access positions at other sandstone crags it is an inept and unhelpful piece of privateering .

If the smoke had <head>climbed</head> to the upper atmosphere , it could have remained airborne for months , travelling much farther and possibly affecting the world 's weather patterns . The computer model at Britain 's  Meteorological Office predicts that the fires '  effect on this year 's  monsoon will probably not stand out against the monsoon 's  annual variations .  Although more oil is ablaze than was first thought ,  there is less oil at sea .

Each must <head>decide</head> as he pleases , according to whether his temperament urges him to prefer the prolific , radiant , almost jovial abundance of Rubens ; the mild dignity and eurhythmic order of Raphael ; the paradisal one might almost say the afternoon colour of Veronese ; the austere and strained severity of David ; or the dramatic and almost literary rhetoric of Lebrun . The critic ,  too ,  according to Baudelaire has a right to be independent ,  and to work without a system which is a kind of damnation which forces one to a perpetual recantation .  He wrote :

Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .  The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in <head>deciding</head> how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits . An extremist view expressed by a twentieth - century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto .  When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .

The critic writing in a newspaper with very limited space needs such a label to give the reader a general idea of what is on display .  Using such a shorthand description leaves space for other topics .  Another consequence of the labelling of Impressionism and other groups by critics was that some artists naturally <head>decided</head> that they themselves could do the same job better than the critics . In Western art there  had been artistic programmes and manifestos before Impressionism ,  but in the twentieth century they proliferated .  Part of the critic 's  task in the nineteenth century ,  as now ,  was to interpret art for the lay public ;  but what ,  artists asked themselves ,  if we interpreted our own work ?  from such a thought sprang statements of artistic aims and manifestos ,  some using the new device of naming a group with a progressive title ,  such as futurism .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .  This has always added to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy <head>deciding</head> what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .  The clergy were and still are in a special position ,  holding power over the laity because of it .

However ,  the earthly role of the community ,  be it protestant or catholic ,  is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,  but as either in continuity with or against it .  The Calvinist vision of an earthly city in which pastor and politician work in harmony to exclude evil from the lives of all those within the city walls remains a religious outlook for a significant number of protestant loyalists .  This is a totalizing view of society , and implies a certain anti - pluralism : freedom of belief and action within certain parameters , which are to be <head>decided</head> either by those who appear righteous in the sight of God or by those who , at least , conform in their lawmaking to the advice given to them by the righteous . The very drift of the account of Christian myth and religious political ethics has certain parallels of structure with the siege of Londonderry .  These should be noted ,  before one views the siege as baseline myth for the interpretation of everyday life .

Perhaps the most important point is that ,  regardless of who may be at the launch point ,  the pilot alone bears the responsibility for accepting or rejecting the launch in the light of the situation as he sees it from the cockpit .

Moreover , if a pilot <head>decides</head> not to launch in a situation like this , he must never be overruled or criticised for playing it safe . Accidents due to swinging on take - off and landing are so common that it is worth studying the causes in detail .  The behaviour of some modern gliders during take - offs and landings is very different to most of the training gliders ,  and it is vital to understand why they are more prone to swinging .

If there is a Will ,  the executor has the right to decide whether it will be a burial or a cremation ,  whether the Will expresses a particular wish or not. If there is no Will , the next of kin should <head>decide</head> . It is important to check whether the deceased has already made arrangements for their own funeral ,  or carried funeral insurance  ( see Section 6 )  .  Funeral directors accept that relatives will seek quotations before they decide which company to use  information can be found in Yellow Pages Directories under the heading funeral directors .

The story of how the traditional management through the regions has been transformed into a marketing one based on the sectors is told elsewhere .  So Far as InterCity is concerned sector management has brought two major benefits :  overall responsibility for deployment of its rolling stock fleet ,  and the building of a national range of express train products .  The first example of equipment redeployment came in 1982 when the then director ( Cyril Bleasdale ) , faced with a serious downturn on Great Western sub - sector services out of Paddington , <head>decided</head> to move ten HSTs to the Midland main line so that a badly needed improvement could be implemented on this potentially profitable and much neglected route . Under the previous organisation it would have taken months of internal wrangling to resolve the conflicting aspirations of regionally based management .  Transfer of all Anglo - Scottish sleeping car services from the East to the West Coast main line from May 1988 was a similar decision based on a corporate rather than a regional viewpoint .

During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy audiences always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six .

When choreographers <head>decide</head> to commission music , they should first give the composer an outline of the plot , roughly suggesting the sequence of the action , the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved . Secondly ,  some description should be given of the characters ,  their moods ,  emotions and particular role in each part of the action .  Thirdly ,  it may be valuable to indicate the style or quality of the movements to be used .

In other words ,  they must take into account another meaning of the word structure  ( see page 70 )  in the sense that it  is the basic framework fur the choreographic design .  As already stated ,  ballets can be roughly divided into the three different kinds usually danced by companies with a classical repertoire .

By the late seventies some British academics were displaying a wary but sympathetic interest in early or classical structuralism ,  particularly as it was expounded in Culler 's  widely read Structuralist Poetics  ,  a lucid ,  urbane work which suggested that structuralism might ,  without too much difficulty ,  be adopted to existing academic practice .  I was partly convinced by Culler 's  power of persuasion ,  and for some time thought that the kinds of analysis he described could be assimilated to practical criticism and the English synthesis .  Eventually I <head>decided</head> that assimilation was not possible , given Culler 's lack of interest in the interpretation of particular texts and his commitment to the uncovering of the generalized principles of literariness . In Structuralist Poetics  Culler took an unenthusiastic view of deconstructionism ,  but he shortly  returned to the United States and succumbed to the deconstructive wave that swept through the American academy in the late seventies ,  and into which I did not feel inclined to plunge .  David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .

On many a winter morning I jumped out of bed and put a letter of his in the fire ,  feeling it would be wrong to allow it to survive ;  and when some years ago I was asked by a distinguished man of letters if I could help him to write an account of Maurice Hewlett ,  I rashly said I would send him some of the letters I had received from him. But when I looked over those I had kept , I <head>decided</head> I could not do so . If many of Hewlett 's  correspondents felt as Mrs Lowndes did ,  this explains why Hewlett 's  letters as edited by Laurence Binyon  ( 1925 )  make such unexciting reading ;  she herself records that of the three hundred letters printed by Binyon there was only one which I felt to be characteristic of the man I knew so well .  Binyon 's  volume does however bear out quite touchingly one point that Mrs Lowndes makes :  that Hewlett 's  ambition was to be known as a poet rather than novelist ,  though it was his historical romances in Wardour Street prose that brought him fame and money .

Louis Untermeyer ,  Robert Frost 's  correspondent who was to be an influential anthologist ,  wrote of Poems  ( The Freeman  ,  30 June 1920 )  that Eliot cares more for his art than he does for his attitudes ;  and that the exaltation which is the very breath of poetry  that combination of tenderness and toughness  is scarcely ever present in Eliot 's  lines .  When The Waste Land  appeared ,  Untermeyer had become more irate :  The Dial 's   award to Mr T. S. Eliot and the subsequent bookpublication of his The Waste Land  have occasioned a display of some of the most enthusiastically naive superlatives that have ever issued from publicly sophisticated iconoclasts .  The poem itself he found a pompous parade of erudition , and he <head>decided</head> that were it not for the Laforgue mechanism , Mr Eliot s poetic variations on the theme of a super - refined futility would be increasingly thin and incredibly second rate ( The Freeman , 17 January 1923 ) . Obviously a writer who is happy with super - refined  ( elsewhere he says that Eliot 's  Portrait of a Lady is extraordinarily sensitized )  is not a critic worth pausing on for long ;  and yet when Untermeyer cites all too patent imitations of Eliot 's  Sweeney Among the Nightingales in quatrains by Osbert Sitwell and Herbert Read and Robert Nichols ,  one can see good reason for him to think that Eliot s reputation ,  achieved so fast on such a slender body of work ,  was no more than modish .  And indeed it asks no great exertion of the historical imagination to recognize that ,  at a time when the Sitwells were taken to be modernists equal with Eliot and Pound ,  modish  was just what Eliot 's  reputation was .

Unless a man can put some thematic invention into vers libre  ,  he would perhaps do well to stick to regular metres ,  which have certain chances of being musical from their form ,  and certain other chances of being musical through his failure in fitting the form .  The one who was  doctrinaire was Williams ,  who regarded the iambic measure as a chief curse of the English legacy from which American poetry must free itself if it was ever to stand on its own .  However , Winters was to <head>decide</head> that Williams was wholly incapable of coherent thought , and when Williams tried to explain his own rhythmical procedures he invented the variable foot which is , as has been remarked , the equivalent of a rubber inch . Williams had a good ear ,  and since his death some of his admirers have made more sense of his procedures than he could ever make for himself ,  but the lamentable effect of his example has been to lead poets to trust their ear implicitly ,  thus discrediting the very notion of measure  .  The closeness of Pound 's  and Eliot 's  collaboration when they were young did not become clear Until 1972 .

Continuing or worsening strife could solidify covenant beliefs into a separate Ulster identity absolutely dominant over the British component ,  and demanding its own independent state form .  It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant  loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state .

The reaction of the first Dil to successive attempts to introduce legislation for divorce was to change standing orders so that such a bill could not be introduced again .  Since the new constitution was enacted in 1937 ,  the prohibition on divorce has become so strict that couples who have been granted a nullity decree by Roman catholic canonical tribunals have found that they may still not be recognized as single by the state ,  and are thus unable to remarry in the Republic .  There has been a <head>degree</head> of attenuation of this rigidity in some respects , but only in favour of the church 's interpretation . People seeking to remarry must first get a divorce abroad  which in practice means Britain .  Naturally ,  apart from the accusation of hypocrisy and of letting Britain solve its marriage problems ,  the government ends up being accused of allowing divorce for the wealthy and none for the poor ,  as the cost of going to and staying in Britain and paying for the legal procedures is beyond the pockets of the majority .

As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,  it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,  and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic  nationalist alliance has still failed to solve .  On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened <head>degree</head> of institutionalized catholic value in law. On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .

In reaction to this ,  one can say that the very way in which the church leaders view the subject is itself revealing of significant mediations between religion ,  state ,  and national ideology in the institutions of schooling .  In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning ,  with social scientists also contributing to papers and discussions .  What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too : the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some <head>degree</head> protected from it . In this writer 's  view ,  the arguments against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .  Hierarchy and clergy are seen almost to monopolize the teaching and wisdom about life .

Storage methods vary considerably , as do the most suitable conditions ( Grenadier apples store best several <head>degrees</head> cooler than Blenheim Orange , or example ) , but as a general rule the place of storage should be dry and cool . A cellar ,  well - ventilated attic or frost - free shed is ideal ,  whereas inhabited rooms are usually too  warm and encourage early dessication .  Never lay crops directly on the floor where it is possible they could suffer from the effects of damp and poor air circulation ,  and arrange produce according to its preference :  the roots nearer to the cool floor ,  and onions and marrows close to the ceiling where it is slightly warmer .

Compass errors are an awful nuisance and it is well worth finding out a little about them .  You also need to become accustomed to thinking and using degrees ,  and deciding whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading .  The easy way to remember it is that for a lesser number of <head>degrees</head> , you turn left , e.g. turning from 350 to 320 is turning to a lesser number and therefore you turn left . Turning point photography If you are aspiring to fly competitions or to get your Gold and Diamond Badges ,  it is essential to take good turning point photographs .

In this situation ,  the marginal mover acquires the power to reinterpret the way his institutional structure governs a desire for a rigidified world of immobility ,  and to understand why ,  for example ,  those few policemen who move into other areas ,  such as probation work or the legal profession ,  become totally suspect .  Transition to the outside destroys the manufactured reality of one real world and two ex - police probation officers I knew became  the equivalent of potential prigs .  Again it is this incomprehension of social mobility which seems to have caused my ACC to describe an officer who took a <head>degree</head> and then left to become a solicitor as a bad experience for the force ( and not a gain for society ) . And it is the same logic which attributes those few out of the 120,000 officers who pursue schemes designed to accelerate promotion with the derisory and metaphorically ephemeral classification of high - flyers or butterfly boys .  I now see that between 1958 and 1977 I was involved in what might well be described as a social drama of movement ,  often crossing boundaries into very marginal areas of policing ,  where the institutional ideal of ordered definition fails simply because the use of power and exercise of authority are based in ambiguity and particular interpretations of what is often poorly framed legislation  ( Burton 1980 )  .

Two weeks after my course finished and I was back in the real world on a murder enquiry ,  I received notification I had been awarded the second scholarship in the force .  My predecessor had read law and obtained a first ,  but I chose to read social anthropology simply because of a pleasure in the subject .  As I have shown above , there is a strong tendency in the organization to dismiss the social sciences , and it therefore seems fair to suggest that any police officer who elects to read for a <head>degree</head> in that discipline is knowingly placing himself into a position of outsider . My inclination to reject law as a possible course was incomprehensible to many ,  and while I was waiting to go to university I was constantly challenged about this .  If I had failed to get a place in a law school and had been forced to take something else as a second choice then this would have been acceptable .

The reason the coding metaphor has such currency in contemporary talk about perception is that it seems to suggest a way in which very simple and apparently homogenous  elements such as nerve impulses can generate the richness and variety of consciousness .

This type of stretching can clearly be dangerous if done before exercise when the muscles are cold ,  and so it should only be used at the end of a training session .

In spite of accounting for only 0.2 per cent of a beer 's  cost ,  this is naturally felt to be wasteful and undesirable .  A greater difficulty of using whole hops is the effect on consistency .  Loss of bitterness depends on the boiling conditions , on the <head>degree</head> , type and time of trub formation and on the yeast action in fermentation .

The physical basis of the measurement leads to a linear response over a wide dynamic range ,  and reduces saturation and hysteresis effects .

In the recent history of British culture the study of English Literature in secondary and tertiary education comprised a recognizable form of life ,  principled but not theoretical .  In institutional practice ,  English in public schools tended to be marginal and somewhat disregarded ,  but became central in the culture of the grammar schools ,  in ways adumbrated and advocated in the Newbolt Report .  That culture presupposed a high <head>degree</head> of what E. D. Hirsch calls cultural literacy , particularly in respect of English history and the Christian and classical heritages , requiring competence in Latin and at least one modern language , as well as wide reading in English Literature over and above the demands of the curriculum . This form of life was shared by the sixth forms of grammar schools and the universities to which their students proceeded ,  and it did not greatly differ whether the frame of reference was Cambridge or Oxford ,  or to import an Arnoldian variation on this model ,  Hebraic or Hellenic ,  directed towards criticism or appreciation .  ( Leavis ,  a forceful opponent of traditional literary education ,  indicated in Education and the University  just how much cultural competence he took for granted in the student .  )

There is the further consideration that universities may not indefinitely be secure havens for literary criticism ,  in the cold economic climate and rampant anti - intellectualism of Thatcherite Britain ,  and of many other parts of the world .   When English was established in British universities criticism played at best a minor part in it .  There was a critical paper in the Oxford <head>degree</head> , but the emphasis was substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the Arnoldian free play of mind . For a long time Oxford English was directed towards scholarship and was suspicious of criticism ,  and this attitude was reflected in its house organ ,  The Review of English Studies  .  Helen Gardner ,  for many years an Oxford luminary ,  did not believe that the purpose of English was to turn out critics ,  any more than it was to produce poets and novelists .

In the high - pressured and directive context of undergraduate teaching it may be desirable ,  but is not practically possible .  Too often ,  even the desirability is not recognized .   It is my experience that many students of English Literature with good A - level results dislike poetry , or at least feel baffled by it , and can go through a three - year <head>degree</head> course without this attitude being radically changed . There are elements of a vicious version of the hermeneutic circle involved :  people do n't like poetry because they have n't read enough to come to terms with it ,  and they have n't read enough because they do n't like it .  Several factors are involved in this unhappy state of affairs :  a general decline in cultural literacy ,  and in skill and practice in reading .

I would certainly not favour a rump version of one of the current forms of English degree ,  with their recurring arguments about canons and coverage ,  the definition of literature ,  and the place of theory .  Instead ,  I propose taking the logic of generic concentration as far as it can go ,  with a degree which would study ,  in detail ,  a single genre ,  poetry .  There are certain academic precedents , particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of universities of degrees in drama , which do work previously thought of as belonging to an English <head>degree</head> . The other model I have in mind is the degree in music ,  which is intensive ,  technical ,  and demanding ,  and attracts a small number of well - qualified entrants .  A degree of a comparable kind ,  directed at poetry ,  is ,  I think ,  feasible ,  and would be more coherent and rewarding than existing degrees in English Literature .

The canon would be largely English ,  not for a priori nationalistic reasons ,  but because it is written in English ,  and until fairly recently most poetry written in English was also written in England ,  or at least ,  in the British Isles .  There is no reason why American poetry ,  or poetry from other anglophone literatures ,  should not be read ,  given a minimal amount of culture and contextual instruction  ( which may also be needed ,  of course ,  in the reading of English poems )  .  To what extent students on such a <head>degree</head> would also need to read poetry in another language is a difficult question . In principle it is extremely desirable ,  not only because of the basic otherness of foreign poetry ,  but because such knowledge gives one a better sense of what English poetry can and cannot do .  In practice ,  given the monoglot tendency in secondary education it might be difficult to recruit students with the necessary competence .

Fascinating as this is ,  it is surely with relief that we return from thus checking printed source against printed source ,  cross - referring and tentatively identifying ,  to the open air of the roads of France .

As dawn broke yesterday ,  the same group ,  this time led by a mother with a baby in arms ,  faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully .  On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy ,  and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies .  West Germany has so far denied , although with a detectable <head>degree</head> of ambiguity , that any deal was made , preferring to point to the humanitarian reasons for allowing an evacuation of the embassy , and the pressure supposedly exerted on East Germany by the Soviet Union to bring the occupation to a speedy end . But from East Germany 's  angry response to the opening of the embassy doors  -  echoed ,  ominously ,  by Czechoslovakia  it appears that East Germany was at least expecting a quid pro quo .  The desire of Hans - Dietrich Genscher ,  the West German Foreign Minister ,  to deliver the West German side of the bargain appears to have been dissolved by the prospect of television pictures showing young East German families ,  including pregnant women ,  hungry and crying on the pavement outside an unwelcoming West German embassy .

Here the <head>degree</head> of complicity is , and perhaps has to be , far higher than the viewer ever suspects . The best analogy is probably with the methods of the legal profession .  In the preparations for any civil trial ,  potential witnesses give written statements to solicitors of one side or the other beginning with that revealing phrase I ,  so - and - so of such - and - such an address ,  will say

But when someone wrote letters on his behalf to The New York Times he was quickly reinstated by the university president ,  and graduated in 1931 .

Then in 1941 America entered the war .  When the US army discovered that Silver had been engaged in research work  ( on Whitman )  he was put to personally testing the durability of uniforms ,  in sub - zero and boiling temperatures ,  artificial rain storms in laboratories and real tropical conditions in Florida :  he soon became an assistant director of this project and stayed there for two years .

Mr Heseltine has long advocated an extension of such agencies to other British regions ,  and Sir Geoffrey 's  new - found support could signal Cabinet debate on industrial policy  an issue which has been omitted from this week 's  conference agenda .  Sir Geoffrey said Britain needed to adopt a less fearful and inhibited approach towards the EC ; arguing that sustained economic recovery depended to a significant <head>degree</head> on an ability to shape Community policies . That means that for economic as well as for political reasons ,  we need to make certain that our power to influence Europe 's  future is as great as can be ,  he said .

Above all ,  does not the cross show that this is how God always acts in and towards the world ,  eternally vulnerable to the worst of pain and suffering which it manifests ?  Now ,  as John Bowker has pointed out in the first article in this series ,  to say that God is not affected by His creatures is not to say that He takes no interest in them ,  nor that ,  seen from our viewpoint as creatures in time and space ,  God cannot do one thing at one moment and something apparently quite different the next .  It is inevitable and right that if we are to make God real for ourselves we must , to a considerable <head>degree</head> , speak of Him in human terms , which is what the Bible does when it speaks of Him as repenting , changing His mind , being provoked or made angry or sorrowful . But we must never forget the inadequacy of all human language before the mystery of God 's  essential being ,  of God as God .  What is important is that God always acts towards us with an outbreak of invariable love ,  the expression of His unchanging nature .

Some of these are worth highlighting in greater detail as a means of contextualizing the data and illustrating some of the social processes operating upon them .  One of the consequences of the RUC 's  dual role is that it has features typical of most police forces and qualities special to it .  This is reflected in the respondents ' sensitivity towards the police management , an enduring theme in the conversation of ordinary policemen and women in any force , and towards the terrorist threat , which is not faced by others to the same <head>degree</head> . The latter makes what is already an internally homogeneous organization even more enclosed and protective .

It is possible to cite one case to illustrate what they try to do for victims which further demonstrates the commitment of the unit to a welfare service role .  An elderly widow who was robbed ,  attacked ,  and raped by a gang of youths was moved to sheltered dwellings with the help of the police ,  visited by policewomen from the unit at least once a week ,  and taken regularly to visit the family of one of the policewomen ,  which adopted her as the children 's  granny .  But this <head>degree</head> of involvement takes its toll on policewomen in the unit . Having to talk little children through the horrors which some adults inflict upon them is horrific and stressful ,  and emotional distancing is difficult to maintain when you are dealing only with sex abuse cases day after day .

Cumberbatch 1983 ,  Taylor - Griffiths 1988 )  .  Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .  In the RUC , for example , a group of policemen and women taking a police studies <head>degree</head> were asked their opinions on community policing , and the following remarks are typical : What gets me about this guy Alderson is that he served in the country area of Cornwall ,  and he makes all these proposals about inner - city policing ;  now how the hell would he know anything about the inner city ?

As an example ,  consider the difficulty experienced by overseas companies wishing to begin direct operations in Japan ,  where applications were vetted by the National Planning Authority to ensure that they fitted the national economic plan of Japan .  At best ,  admission was obtained only on the basis of a joint venture with a Japanese company ,  and entry of any kind was often impossible to obtain ,  at least until the Japanese themselves had established a strong presence  domestically and internationally  in the market sector concerned .  This situation has been ameliorated to a <head>degree</head> , in the face of overseas pressure to change the system , not least because of the Japanese need to maintain its market position in other countries , and concern about retaliatory measures against Japanese imports . This sort of interdependence of interests is a feature of the relations between industrialised countries ;  having built a strong overseas market position ,  a country will be forced to take more account of external pressures if that strong position is to be maintained .  The future behaviour of Japan ,  then ,  may be analysed in terms of the balance between commercial self - interest and the basic protectionist nature of many of the trade restrictions which still exist .

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .

By criticizing the Conservative Party mid - term the right - wing press can build up a certain <head>degree</head> of credibility with its readers which it can then use to maximum effect by suspending criticism of the Conservative Party and increasing its attacks on Labour as the election approaches . Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tabloid press stores up suitable material for use in election campaigns .

In the event ,  he was accepted at Birmingham University ,  but just before he arrived he was informed that the geography department had been closed down because of austerity measures brought in during World War N. He therefore decided to read geology instead ,  but shortly afterwards he received notification that this department was also to be closed .  The next best option was to take a BSc <head>degree</head> in coal - mining and that was how he ended up becoming a mining engineer instead of a teacher , which in all probability is the career he would have followed if he had managed to fulfil his original goal of studying geography . Forty years later ,  after an enormously varied industrial career that has seen Haslam running a diverse range of businesses and involved in a wide variety of functions ,  from selling to personnel ,  events have turned full circle .  His early days underground working alongside miners on the coal - face have imbued him with a special rapport with the thousands of miners he now oversees as chairman of British Coal .

His survival over the years since independence in 1961 does not alter the fact that the discussion of real policy choices in a public manner has hardly ever occurred .  This is not to say that the National Executive Committee of the ruling party allows Nyerere total control of the party and therefore of government policy ;  in fact there have always been a number of important policy issues which Nyerere has had to argue through the NEC and which he has not always won .  One such issue since the Union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964 has been the <head>degree</head> of influence of leading Zanzibari politicians in the affairs of the mainland government and party , and the status of Zanzibar in general . Another ,  in the late 1960s ,  was the position of the Ruvuma Development Association  ( RDA )  ,  a group of seven villages near Songea in the extreme south - western corner of Tanzania which grouped themselves in an association of mutual support designed to foster their development and which were ultimately compulsorily disbanded in 1969 .  However ,  none of the major stages in Tanzania 's  development as a centralized socialist state were publicly discussed in any way which made open debate possible .

For Engels ,  by contrast ,  the possibility revealed by the gentile constitution was a major guarantee that the Marxist vision of the withering away of the State in a future communist society was not a recipe for chaos ,  as was argued by his opponents .  The correlation which Morgan and Engels make between very simple agriculture and herding and the gentile constitution is a rare example of a proposition of this kind which has held up fairly well in the light of recent research .

The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated  ( if overstated )  in these books .  If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed  ( SI through Fluxus ,  Heatwave ,  King Mob ,  Jamie Reid ,  Vivienne Westwood ,  and the Sex Pistols )  the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence  ( typified by King Mob in Britain ,  the Motherfuckers in the USA ,  and also indirectly the punk phenomenon )  but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life .  The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large <head>degree</head> derives from Marx 's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism , Lukcs 's development of this critique , and the Marxist - existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre . The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences .  The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers '  Council  after World War One provided a ready - made model of a non - hierarchical political system .

Yet in Victorian Britain the alliance of wealth and birth formed in the public schools infused sport with a new idealism whilst simultaneously segregating the lite from members of the lower classes taking the same form of exercise .  What were the implications of this for the process of commercialization ?  More striking than the provision of popular entertainment for profit was the remarkable <head>degree</head> to which the landed interest , the liberal professions , and even sections of the business community itself excluded commercial forces from sport . The rule of sport by amateurs kept capitalism at bay in British sport .  All sports came to make sharp distinctions between those who received payment and those who did not.

Nowhere in the vast press coverage and literature of match reports is there any reference to the growth of a violent ,  organized youth subculture within football .  Casual ,  individual violence was almost certainly more common than today but hooliganism in the collective and contemporary sense did not take place at football matches .  It is unacceptable to deduce from the lack of prosecutions that hooligan behaviour was formerly tolerated to such a <head>degree</head> that the culprits were neither censured nor prosecuted . The argument from silence will not do ,  especially in the late Victorian era .  During the second half of the nineteenth century the police were increasingly active against all sorts of minor public offences such as drunken or disorderly behaviour or the playing of street games .

He suggested that cattle grazing in the ideal landscape should be any other colour than black and white ,  which make together the most inharmonious of all mixtures .

The truth was revealed only by chance ,  when a journalist for the US magazine Sports Illustrated  happened to be aboard a boat when it hauled up seven dead porpoises ,  caught in a single set .

So far , with Worrell having turned down the chance , no one had been able to complain about the captaincy ; but by now Worrell had his <head>degree</head> , was very much available , and Alexander himself expected him to be made captain for the tour by England in 195960 . Instead ,  Alexander was reappointed .  Perhaps it was a show of  support for his disciplining of Gilchrist ;  perhaps there was the feeling that Worrell had drifted away from the hub of West Indies cricket ;  or perhaps once again the selectors simply could not bring themselves to appoint a black man.

A small collection can be monitored regularly by carrying out a check of all objects against the register ,  but in the case of a very large collection this may well be impracticable .  The British Museum has  ( or is believed to have )  some 5 or 6 million objects ,  so that a conventional stock - take of the entire collection could occupy all the qualified staff for five or six years and could be exhaustive only if all other duties were suspended for the duration .  However , a branch of statistics called sampling theory can be applied , which will allow conclusions about the entire collection to be inferred ( to within a known <head>degree</head> of certainty ) by checking on a small percentage of it . Statistical sampling is widely used in scientific experiments and market surveys .  It also has applications in field archaeology where financial or time constraints preclude excavation of more than part of a site ,  and where it is therefore important that the excavated part yields as much information as possible .

The exercises  were specifically directed to obtaining this effect .  A main real <head>difference</head> in the experience which marked it off from fundamentalist and some pentecostal forms of conversion experience was that the outcome was not the assurance of being saved , but rather a spirituality of trust in Christ based on repentance and the conviction that God forgives repentant sinners .

The trust implied fidelity or commitment ,  together with an abandoning of the old ways of sin and indifference for a total dedication to God 's  will in Christ .

This research at home is primarily about the society of the self and the self in that society .

Inevitably it has qualitative <head>differences</head> and is not easily written or smoothly integrated into the isms or historical categories of the discipline . Material obtained in such circumstances inevitably contains the seeds of a special inside knowledge ,  avoiding problems described by Liebow  ( 1967 :  23256 )  ,  who was still separated by cognitive barriers while pursuing research in what was ostensibly his own society ,  and who found an insider 's  language ,  education ,  and social membership all helped to retain boundaries he was unable to penetrate .  The semantic ability of the insider to translate the hidden and the unspoken aspects of the cultural agenda which occur in any society should be especially productive in any analysis of the police ,  where a massive visibility at one level is matched by a secretive ,  hidden side to institutional practice .

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform <head>difference</head> were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

If Let Us Compare Mytholoqies  marks the awakening of his poetic consciousness when the city of Montreal  ( and all that was in it ,  not excluding its female charms )  began to jump at me ,  The Spice - Box Of Earth  marks the heightening of his Jewish consciousness which he  encountered in young adulthood ,  as a free agent abroad in the world ,  having to establish his own identity at a time when his own Tradition ,  and his position in it ,  began likewise to jump at him.

Ondaatje perceived this and described the book as being far nastier and more frightening than Flowers For Hitler  ;  but the choice of words is unjust :  there is nothing nasty or frightening about honest observation .  Such value - judgments surely arise out of the critics '  disappointment at finding negative aspects in an otherwise positive projection ,  an all -   to   - human aspiration for avoiding reality which Leonard refuses to do ,  to his great cost .  Manzano has drawn attention to a real <head>difference</head> when he says ( of both these first books ) , In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself , and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world , a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by , though Leonard 's anarchism remained personal and mainly verbal . He is wont to talk of the new vision that Lorca 's  poetry gave to him ;  here is my landscape ,  he exclaimed repeatedly .  But that other landscape ,  quieter perhaps ,  but like an underground stream ,  unconscious and very persistent ,  never failed to obtrude itself on him :  It is strange that even now prayer is my natural language ,  he said ,  in Lines From My Grandfather 's  Journal  ( The Spice - Box Of Earth ,  p10 )  which powerfully reflect his own self - questionings ;  the tyranny was asserting itself .

On the other hand ,  materialists seem to be prevented by their materialism from allowing that there is any relevant fact that BS does not know .  The way that most materialists try to reconcile their flight from behaviourism with their materialist world picture is to say that when V sees something ,  and BS observes V 's  brain ,  BS knows everything about V 's  mental states that V himself knows ,  but that he knows about it in a different way  .  It is this <head>difference</head> of way which constitutes the difference of feel in their experience . This reply sounds very plausible ,  until one reflects on it ;  and then a serious difficulty emerges .

It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .  But the question is how this constitutes a subjective <head>difference</head> .

In brief ,  topic neutrality was invoked to explain why ,  within the materialist scheme ,  consciousness of our mental states is not sufficient for knowledge of them as  brain states :  what it cannot do is explain why knowledge of brain states is not sufficient for knowledge of their nature as conscious states .  A rather similar ,  and equally mistaken ,  line of thought which might appeal is as follows .  It might be thought that the subject 's apprehension of his own brain is more immediate and more holistic than any external knowledge , however complete , and that this explains the experiential <head>difference</head> between the two kinds of knowledge . The scientist has essentially separate pieces of information ,  whereas the subject has a sort of Gestalt  .

How is a cognisant episode such as this going to be analysed away into the language of activity ?  Well clearly it is not  going to yield to any such analysis ,  and to believe that it will is to deny the reality of subjective life and to side with the behaviourists .  What I can say , however , is that the constructivist position allows a distinctive analysis of the mental when we speak of a mental representation of a green patch : it helps us to understand the <head>difference</head> between mental representations and the non - mental variety ( a photograph for example ) . At the time of looking up we ascribe an experience of greenness to ourselves ;  we consider the experience as something being undergone by us before any decision is taken about its veridicality .  Such an ascription is a cognisant act involving ,  at the very least ,  a conception of a one 's  self ,  a conception of experience ,  and a conception of veridicality .

Of course ,  nobody as yet knows how intentionality  the property that mental phenomena have of being about  something other than themselves  or consciousness emerge from the operations of the brain .  From the perspective of functionalism  ( and from the perspective of other materialist theories also )  ,  however ,  this is a question for science rather than an imponderable problem of metaphysics .  Searle ( 1984 , pp. 1821 ) strongly supports the view that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties , but there is at least one important <head>difference</head> between Searle 's account of emergent properties and the one I am advocating here . I have no quarrel with Searle 's  claim that mental phenomena are caused by processes going on in the brain .

Europe appeared to accept her <head>difference</head> and individuality , whereas England demanded that she should somehow conform , assimilate , and yet at the same time , there was no way in which it was possible to really assimilate .

TILING WALLS The best way to practise your tiling skills if you 've never done any before if by covering just a small area such as a washbasin splashback ,  where setting out the tiles so they are centred on the area concerned is a simple job ,  and you have the minimum of tile cutting to do .  When you are tackling a larger area a whole wall , or perhaps even a complete room you use exactly the same techniques ; the big <head>difference</head> is the sheer scale of the job , which makes the preliminary setting - out by far the most important part . The problem is that unless you have absolutely plain walls ,  there will be a number of obstacles to tile round ,  and you have to decide how to get the best fit round them with your inflexible tile squares ,  without ending up cutting impossibly thin slivers to fill in all the gaps .  You may also want to tile awkward shapes such as the window recesses ,  or things like bath surrounds .

Light hearted With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the <head>difference</head> in photon energy ( E ' E = hf ' hf ) of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity ( v ) acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon . The extra energy not being allowed to be expressed as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f ,  that is :   ( formula included )  where m is the photon equivalent mass  ( yes I know it is related to E  but I am trying not to confuse myself )  ,  E  is the energy ,  and h  is Mr Plank 's  claim to fame .  I write this letter in the hope that someone will explain the errors of my ways ,  forgive me for mixing relativistic and Newtonian physics ,  and enlighten me .

The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?

The <head>difference</head> goes far deeper than the political complexion of the government . The strong tendency of pluralistic systems of Europe is consensual and ,  in some cases ,  quasi - corporatist ;  on the other side of the coin ,  they enable extremist minorities to thrive .  Our system is adversarial in style ,  friendly to class - based ,  ideological parties ,  it effectively excludes minorities from the parliamentary arena ,  and results almost invariably in one - party rule.

The dock strike failed because the transport workers did not have the strength to defend the labour monopoly enjoyed by registered dockers in a number of ports once the Government removed its statutory underpinning .  At much the same time ,  however ,  workers on British Rail successfully defended their procedures in the courts and subsequently went on to conduct a very effective strike from which they emerged victorious .  Unions are demonstrating a growing sophistication and success in their use of the law , while the courts are increasingly aware of the <head>difference</head> between an employer who is frivolously testing his rights to its limits and an enterprise with genuine reason for seeking an interim injunction .

A 1985 Lancia Y10  ( lead only )  sells for around 2,000 whereas the similar Fiat Uno 55 from the same year ,  converted to run on unleaded ,  is worth around 500 more .  A lead - only second - hand car is now worth about 10 per cent less than an unleaded equivalent .  In years to come the percentage <head>difference</head> is likely to be much larger . Even so ,  exotica such as lead - only Porsche 911s and Ferraris are unlikely to be part of this trend ,  so no bargains there I 'm afraid .  More impressive are the Japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early Eighties can run on unleaded without adjustment .

But there was a limit to what Mr Aczel ,  the party 's  ideologist ,  could tolerate and the gradual thaw was frequently punctuated with repressive measures against those who fell out of line .

Though he was clearly the more liberal half of the Aczel - Pozsgay tandem , he lost his job because of personal <head>differences</head> with his boss and not , as he claimed , for political reasons . Mr Pozsgay was simply fed up with playing second fiddle ,  a characteristic that was to re - emerge later .

Cardiff ,  whose rucking and mauling remains sub - standard ,  at least possess a pair of half - backs with the wit and ability to make best use of the ball they do get .  David Evans ,  the stand - off who plays centre for Wales ,  and Andrew Booth ,  his scrum - half partner ,  virtually sealed the result in the second half simply by appreciating what the Newport pair ,  David Phillips and Nigel Callard ,  had failed to grasp in the first  that kicking downwind is as good a way as any of gaining huge chunks of ground to keep the pressure on .  The simple <head>difference</head> in rugby intellect plus a glaring weakness in Newport 's defensive cover allowed Cardiff to improve a 12 - 9 interval deficit with four second - half tries . The best Newport had to offer was a solid front row ,  the line - out jumping of their veteran lock ,  David Waters ,  and a passion which ,  in the case of 19 - year - old No. 8 Ian McKim ,  needs restraining .  McKim ,  a Wales youth player last season and new to some of the more unwelcome machinations of senior rugby ,  lost his temper so totally after a brush with the Cardiff prop Jeff Whitefoot that he even lashed out at Newport 's  skipper ,  Glen George ,  who was trying to cool him down.

Although the Army and MI5 still retain some independent intelligence gathering capabilities in the province ,  the system is now largely centralised and works well  the IRA itself has admitted that one of the reasons it has exported a growing proportion of its violence to the continent and mainland Britain is because it has become increasingly risky for them to operate on home territory .  But in the mid - 1970s there was an acrimonious conflict between the different intelligence gathering agencies in the province .

Lower trade barriers permitted their development ,  and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that treated markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale .

To some extent the <head>difference</head> between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics : the term global company does not mean the same to each . Yet there is greater emphasis in the transnational company model on the complete integration and interdependence of operating structures .

Such comparisons are often difficult due to lack of available data ,  and comparisons are often made by measuring GNP per capita in local currency and using the exchange rate of the currency against an international standard  ( typically US  )  .  However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The <head>differences</head> in real income can thus be distorted . As just one example ,  agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries ,  and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent differences in per capita income .  Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .

So amongst tabloid readers generally , but especially amongst Sun/Star readers , there was a dramatic <head>difference</head> between their overwhelming preference for television as a source of information and their reliance upon both press and television for helping them decide how to vote .

These findings broadly echo those of Gunter ,  Svennevig ,  and Wober  ( 1986 ,  pp.989 )  ,  whose study of the 1983 election campaign showed that objectively measured knowledge was significantly correlated with interest  in political discussion programmes both on radio and television ,  but with only one news - consumption  variable  claimed viewing of television news  ( italics added )  .  In our analysis of the 1987 campaign we have distinguished more  clearly between personal factors such as political interest and mobilizing factors such as television viewing ;  and we have detected a strong trend in the balance of influence between these two influences .  In the Pre - Campaign Wave there was a 41 per cent <head>difference</head> in awareness of polls between those with a high and low interest in politics . Following J. S. Coleman 's  terminology we can say that the effect of political interest on awareness of opinion polls was 41 per cent in the pre - Campaign Wave .

Indeed ,  instead of declining ,  the effect of political interest on awareness of other Conservative politicians actually rose from 32 per cent to 37 per cent between the Pre - Campaign Wave and the end of the campaign ,  and its effect on awareness of other Labour politicians declined only from 38 per cent to 34 per cent .  Overall , there remained a roughly constant <head>difference</head> between the interested and the uninterested .

So ,  apart from age making people personally pessimistic about their own circumstances ,  economic perceptions were primarily influenced by a combination of personal political prejudice  ( partisanship )  and biased information sources  ( right - wing or left - wing papers )   ( Table 7.14 )  .

There was always an enormous <head>difference</head> between the economic perceptions of those who initially had Conservative and Labour preferences , especially those who described themselves as party supporters .

It is difficult to see that as anything other than an attempt to intimidate the BBC .  Our content analysis of national television news in Chapter 4 suggests that television news was biased both towards the government of the day  ( through extra coverage of the government )  and towards right - wing political viewpoints  ( through its emphasis on crime ,  defence ,  and security )  .  Our comparison of BBC - TV with ITV in Chapter 5 showed that there was little <head>difference</head> between them . Our opinion survey in Chapter 6 showed that most voters felt television news on both networks was unbiased ;  but amongst the minority who felt it  was biased a majority thought it was biased towards the Conservatives and against both Labour and the Alliance .  At the same time a large majority of voters thought that the press was biased ,  and that it was biased towards the Conservatives ,  against Labour ,  and against the Alliance .

Both nations were highly centralized ,  and both underwent fundamental revolutions ,  but their geographical scale and relationship to national minorities were  very different .  After 1789 politicians were the main architects of French nationalism ,  but in Russia at the start of NEP Marxist internationalism and Trotsky 's  theory of permanent revolution still imbued most leading Bolsheviks ,  with the significant exception of Stalin ,  whose treatment of Georgia in 1922 was to shock Lenin .

If the two girls compare notes one day ,  the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ;  the newspaper articles were almost always short ,  written maybe by hard - pressed critics who were only allowed short articles ,  further cut down by sub - editors .  Still ,  by reading ,  and looking at Lee Krasner 's  pictures in New York galleries ,  she was able to defend an independent liking for her SoHo artist .  In London , it was a rather <head>different</head> story , since the literature available needed discrimination , much of it being historical and iconographic , establishing data of little interest to the art student . To her surprise ,  there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo 's  work ,  almost hidden in catalogue entries ;  more than one art historian ,  apparently ,  was not only learned but had an eye .

A teacher 's  list for analysing pictures may be something like that of the American educationalist Thomas Munro :  first impressions of the picture as a whole ,  line ,  light and dark ,  colour ,  mass ,  space ,  unity of design .  Books on art appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions ,  as they have done since the beginning of the century .  In a book called How to Appreciate Pictures by R. C. Witt , written in 1902 , the chapter headings are not so <head>different</head> : drawing , colour , light and shade , composition , treatment , methods and materials . A supplementary approach to school art instruction is to draw attention to the types of subject in art ,  such as portraiture ,  narrative ,  landscape .  This thematic method is combined in many introductory courses with formal analysis which is closer to the way that many artists describe pictures .

In discussing Drer ,  he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate ,  whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden .  Of the latter he wrote ,  Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer ,  and prone to lose himself in imitation of stronger men ,  each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style .  Another book about the age of Drer , but on a <head>different</head> topic , is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany , by Michael Baxandall , published in 1980 . The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .  Divisions in the book are unusually clear ,  separate chapters being given to topics such as function ,  the market ,  or the historical and political background of the subject .

When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .  The title will only serve to confirm my impression .  In a <head>different</head> context , but also on the issue of religion , an American book on the Aztecs by the archaeologist Vaillant commented tartly : The Aztecs did not have a term for fine arts ,  nor did they speculate about aesthetics ,  nor make objects to be contemplated for their beauty alone .  They had none of the socially sterile attitude towards art which we adopt in our own culture .

Instead ,  he put a rich range of clear rainbow colours on his palette ,  replacing the dirty ochre colours with light and more luminous chromium colours ,  with the addition of Veronese green ,  ultramarine and lacquer colours ,  and following the Impressionist recipe in not mixing these colours with anything except white or closely allied colours .  Interpretation of the artist 's  work ,  however ,  depends on the artist 's  own account ,  since Nordenfalk had the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker .  The sober intentions of his book were very <head>different</head> from the novels , plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected , recognised only after his death , and whom the phrase genius and madness are near aligned seems to fit . The novel Lust for Life  by Irving Stone ,  published in 1934 ,  is the most famous of these productions ,  popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh 's  first advocates ,  such as the taste - maker Julius Meier - Graefe ,  who defended Van Gogh in 1906 ,  and went on to write a book in his praise in 1921 called Vincent  .  But this was a drama ,  the story of the circumstances of Van Gogh 's  life ;  No attempt has  been made ,  wrote Meier - Graefe ,  to make a critical analysis of the pictures ,  which enter upon the scene only in so far as they concern the drama directly or indirectly .

Sculpture parks are an enjoyable innovation of the late twentieth century ,  or perhaps it would be better to say a welcome adaptation of an existing practice .  In the seventeenth century Louis XIV had a sculpture park at Versailles ,  but it surrounded his palace ,  and was more formally designed by Le Ntre ,  who needed sculptures for the focal points of his avenues .  Twentieth - century sculpture parks are less rigidly planned , and intended to accommodate sculpture by artists in many <head>different</head> styles . The site can be adapted to suit the sculpture ,  which has a dominant role ,  unlike sculpture destined for the decoration of palatial gardens .  Commemorative figures in city squares ,  portrait busts ,  tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions .

A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .  There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ;  there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ;  and there are exhibitions in dealers '  galleries ,  notably solo shows .  The catalogues which accompany these events have rather <head>different</head> characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each sort of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years ,  usually through the help of national ,  industrial or commercial sponsorship .  A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like The Age of Rembrandt ,  or Shock of Recognition ;  the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth - century school ;  both of these are actual titles .

The nature of Burne - Jones 's  aims and predilections in art are well - enough known by this time ,  and have been defined by himself absolutely fitted to this thought :  I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something that never was ,  never will be  in a light better than any light that ever shone  in a land no one can define or remember ,  only desire .  If any one element in his style is to be singled out as predominant ,  it is that haunting expression of far - away desire never absent from the eyes and lips ,  and conveyed in every gesture ,  feature and attitude .  Giacometti was an artist with very <head>different</head> artistic aims , clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington , in 1988 . Writing about a small bust on a column ,  a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form ,  she comments that the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base .  So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element appears ephemeral .

Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance sort had not been used in European medieval art ,  where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's  importance ,  God the father never being small .  A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again , in Chinese art perspective is <head>different</head> from its treatment in the West . There is one sort of Chinese perspective ,  seen as in the West from a level viewpoint ,  but this is only one of three treatments of space representation .  It can be identified with p'ing yuan  ,  when one is able to see from the near parts to the furthest parts .

The point of making these comparisons is that artistic practices affect how a critic should describe a landscape .  Suppose a scene is said to be in correct perspective ?  This description could mean several <head>different</head> things . Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry <head>different</head> information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

But the literal Levi is a writer who has his own way of interesting himself in the contrasts which have been attributed to Babel .

There must be some affinity between you and the man or woman on the printed page  something that you recognise not because you are just like that but because you feel that you can interpret the situation with those words .  Let us look at Romeo and Juliet  .

Bernard Shaw once described Romeo and Juliet  as the impetuous march of music ,  and if ever there was a play of rich language ,  this is it .  The music of the words is there to be used  but not at the expense of the sense and emotional content .

They can be reliably dug out again only by averaging over many presentations so that the random background fluctuations cancel each other out ,  leaving just the potential shifts that are linked in time to the triggering event .  Averaging of this kind was first done at the National Hospital in London in the 1940s by George Dawson ,  initially using a technique of photographic superimposition and then later a system of addition using banks of condensers ,  but it was the electronic processing and computing power of the 1960s and 1970s which made the accurate timing of these averaged potentials possible ,  resulting in a rapid expansion in ERP research .  Since then , correlations have been reported between potential shifts and a wide variety of <head>different</head> events , ranging from simple and complex sensory stimuli to whole sequences of behaviour or even internally generated mental events . It is now being claimed that the ERP allows the objective monitoring of well specified mental activities .  As Fergus Campbell has suggested ,  if the ERP can tell us whether or not the subject has seen a light ,  it takes the psycho out of psychophysics .

Some of these changes will be related to neural processes that have little psychological relevance .  Nor is there any reason to suppose that the peaks and valleys of the fluctuations have greater neural or psychological significance than any other intermediate point .  So sorting out what is going on in an ERP is like untangling a complex bundle of many <head>different</head> strands of similar wool with one hand tied behind the back . Given this ,  the progress that has been made is remarkable ,  particularly in relating components of the ERP to attentional processes .  Whether or not we perceive an event in the world around us  depends on three things .

In both cases it is the position of the lips that conveys much of the vital information .  If it is the simple physical characteristics of a stimulus that play the key role in generalizations about behaviour ,  then we might expect to find patients who have lost the ability to lip - read and lost the ability to judge expression ,  but not patients who have lost only one of these two abilities while retaining the other. According to the functionalist , of course , facial expression and lip - reading are likely to be dealt with by distinct parts of the information - processing system because the nature of the information that they convey is so <head>different</head> . Therefore the dissociation which Campbell and her colleagues have demonstrated between lip - reading and expression analysis makes perfect sense from a functionalist perspective .  Phenomenology

The basis of these unities does not seem to lie within the nervous system as it is currently conceived .

But the scattered activity of <head>different</head> parts of the nervous system seems to converge only at the cost of merging , and so losing , the components that come together in the process of convergence , rather in the manner of snowflakes joining a drift . There is no neurophysiological model of the kind of convergence that would seem to be necessary for the many different sensations of the moment to be brought into synthetic unity ,  without loss of their individual distinctiveness and specificity ,  into the instantaneous sense of being here ;  or of the manner in which experience of many different moments can be synthesized into a sense of continuing self without those moments losing their separateness in memory .  As for the recovery of consciousness ,  or wakefulness ,  there is no imaginable physiology of this light dawning over the whole .

The cutting head is a router with a variable speed control  ( 030,000rpm )  which is attached to the same shaft as a stylus .  As the stylus is moved over a pattern ,  the router duplicates the original .  Movement can be in any one , or a combination of five <head>different</head> ways , so allowing intricate shaping and undercutting with very little experience . A pattern can be almost any material ,  even plaster which has had a layer of sealer on it .  It is also possible to modify the original by adding or omitting parts ,  or even combining different patterns into one carving .

However it is not necessary to own all the available shapes ,  some have very specific uses which may only needed on rare occasions .  When a special tool has been developed ,  it is usually because nothing else will do the job as well .

You see ,  when you are working in plan like this it is difficult to bear in mind that machine table heights can work in your favour and they can also work against you .  For example ,  if you have the situation where you want to put two occasionally - used machines quite close to one another ,  it may be to your advantage that their heights are exactly the same so the job can run across both tables .  The converse of this can apply if your table heights are at <head>different</head> levels . Most bandsaws ,  for example ,  have a table considerably above the common machine table height which may enable you to cast long jobs above other machines .  Most planer - thicknessers have a thicknessing table below common machine height ,  so position your thicknesser very carefully .

She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .

I must admit therefore that there is one passage in this otherwise consummate design  (  A Fruit Dish  )  of which the meaning escapes me .  I cannot see the necessity of the shadow cast by a half - opened drawer in the kitchen table .  ,  It is encouraging to find Fry underlining a point about critical writing  that with a description of a work of art it can be useful to be given an explicit account of how the critic responds .  Another point is also made explicitly . : his <head>difficulty</head> is assessing Czanne 's work at the end of the century . It is more difficult to be precise about this than about the earlier phases ,  partly because the pictures are rarer and less accessible ,  and have not been adequately photographed ,  partly because it includes considerable variations .  Fry 's  book contains rather little biographical information ,  the focus being firmly on Czanne 's  work .

The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies ,  and published in 1951 .  the strength of the gallery 's  holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's  while to write a preliminary note about difficulties of attribution :  A definition of Bellini 's  oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting .  The first <head>difficulty</head> is , despite the destructions , the enormous number of existing pictures , many of them signed , and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque . It is obvious that Bellini had assistants to help him in his studio ;  indeed ,  there is documentary proof of that .  But the question of what pictures are entirely or for practical purposes Bellini 's  own is answered largely by personal taste ;  there is therefore a considerable divergence of view .

A climate of artistic opinion is as tricky to predict as the English weather ,  and also quite as changeable .  Both writers and readers are affected by generally accepted ideas ,  without necessarily having given them independent thought .  One <head>difficulty</head> in describing a climate of opinion is this fact : that many shared views are not stated openly , but assumed . A set of assumptions may be challenged by an outsider ,  and at this moment these shared views come into focus .

A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .

Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .

Sheets are usually 300mm  ( 12in )  square ,  and are often sold in packs of five or 10 ;  the best way of estimating quantities is to work out the area to be covered ,  and to divide that by the coverage figure given on the pack ,  which will tell you how many packs to buy .

It is made to the usual high Wolfcraft standards using thick steel for the bench table and a cast alloy housing for the disc .  The disc itself spins easily on a sealed ball - bearing race .  The sander is clamped on to the edge of a workbench so the <head>disc</head> is vertical and the shank of the disc is locked securely into your power - drill chuck most drills with a standard 43mm diameter neck are suitable . It is important to set the drill on a high speed setting  ( 5,000rpm maximum )  ,  and the disc must turn in the direction shown by the arrow on the housing .  The bench table is clamped securely in position by means of two tommy bar bolts .

SOUND on the Apple Macintosh has its roots in comedy .  Games have made noises through the Mac speaker ever since its introduction ,  and many early systems were afflicted with a true celebration of the typical Mac programmer 's  sense of humour .  This was a small operating system patch by the name of MacPuke , which made the innocuous little beige box belch in a particularly corpulent , beer - sodden way when the operating system decided to eject a floppy <head>disc</head> from the drive . This and similar programs have spread through the Macintosh community 's  excellent Public Domain  ( PD )  software network .  And nowadays ,  users of the newer Macs may benefit from larger speakers and earphone sockets ,  projecting sounds which the original machines mumbled .

For objects which need some thickness of metal ,  like ingots or axes ,  casting is the obvious method ,  while others ,  like fine wire or thin sheet metal ,  need extensive working .  In many cases ,  however ,  the method used is not immediately obvious .  For example , a bowl may be formed by casting , by hammering up the sides from a fiat <head>disc</head> , or by a combination of casting ( for the basic dish shape ) and working up details , like the rim . In rare instances ,  there is still evidence of manufacturing methods ,  for example the clay moulds used for casting bronze bridle bits and other equestrian equipment found at the Iron Age site of Gussage All Saints or stone moulds for weapons  ( fig. 5.7 )  .  Other clues to the manufacturing process might be found by examining the object itself .

When a <head>disc</head> is rolled about a disc of equal diameter , the roller makes two revolutions about its own centre . This principle is used in differential gears .

Philips ,  the Dutch electronics company which invented the CD ,  long ago dropped its original advertising slogan :  Perfect sounds forever .  A spokesman said yesterday that the company promised a lifetime 's  use if the CDs were manufactured correctly .  Some manufacturers guarantee CDs for only 30 years but Mr Bert Gall , general manager of optical systems at Philips , said the life of the average disc should be more than 1,000 years , though it could be reduced to 50 if manufacturing was poor and the <head>discs</head> were mistreated . The main problem is that the stored sound can be lost when the thin layer of aluminium which coats a CD 's  plastic surface is oxidised ,  losing its ability to reflect laser light .  European CD manufacturers have begun a regular exchange of information on quality to help improve the discs '  longevity and hope to agree on an international standard testing procedure involving exposure of the discs to heat and humidity .

It is a tribute to EMI engineers of the time and their faithful successors today that this and the even earlier  ( 1937 )  version of Sibelius 's  Fourth Symphony come up sounding so truthful  ( CDM7 64027 2 )  .  This <head>disc</head> , running almost to 80 minutes , also includes his accounts of other Sibelius works Leminkainen 's Return , The Tempest and The Bard , all in authoritative readings . A favourite composer of Beecham 's  was Berlioz ,  so it 's  good to have back in circulation his famous 1957 performance of the Symphonie Fantastique with the French National Radio Orchestra  ( CDM7 64032 2 )  coupled with the overtures King Lear ,  made with the RPO ,  and the pre - War and still vivid Carnival Romain with the LPO ;  even if the recording of the last is a bit confined .

The starfish are among the most important of invertebrate predators living today .  They make major depredations on oyster beds and the recent activities of the Crown of Thorns starfish  (  Acanthaster  )  in chewing up great chunks of the Great Barrier Reef have become a modern ecological object lesson  ( and ,  incidentally ,  a source of funds for many marine biologists )  .

Ophiuroids are especially abundant in deep sea environments ,  and it is unusual for a deep sea dredge to miss one of these small animals .

Consequently ,  the good old gentleman got his watch back .  When most people possessed no clocks or watches but lived more in the countryside than they do today ,  they took far more note than we do of the various timings associated with plants and animals .

Control of protein synthesis is the central issue in cell differentiation and development .

The next milestone was the idea of mass - producing copies of recordings .  This involved making a negative version of the recording ,  with ridges instead of grooves ,  so the copies could be formed from that .  The <head>disc</head> records invented by Berliner were the first to possess this advantage , since they could be stamped out almost like printing . They also permitted a much simpler reproducing machine ,  since the groove itself propelled the soundbox ,  no additional screw mechanism being necessary  ( 7 )  .  At first ,  the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same  about two minutes  but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes ,  all of which could be played on the same machine ,  was another advantage .

At first ,  the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same  about two minutes  but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes ,  all of which could be played on the same machine ,  was another advantage .  In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch disc  ( playing for three minutes )  was better for most types of music ,  even popular songs ,  and the popular single was born .  Although cylinder manufacturers countered effectively for some decades , first with moulding techniques and later with finer grooves , the overwhelming simplicity of being able to press thousands of copies of <head>disc</head> records and play them on a simple machine eventually told in the disc 's favour . Certainly it became economic to pay recording artists large fees ;  and without mass - production ,  few recordings of top   artists would survive in playable form today .    7 A Berliner Gramophone .

This speed was then adopted for Victor 's  first long - playing records of 193134 .

It was difficult enough to cut a perfect master 78rpm <head>disc</head> with a duration of only five minutes . To cut a perfect long - playing side without stopping imposed intolerable demands on everyone .

By 1982 ,  Sony 's  system ,  using its U - Matic videocassettes for storing 16 - bit digital audio  ( with a potential signal - to - noise ratio of some 96 decibels )  ,  had become an industry standard .  Meanwhile , Philips in Holland had been pioneering the use of Laservision videodiscs , the least unsuccessful of several types of <head>disc</head> for carrying video films . These were played by a beam of laser light rather than a stylus ,  and Philips saw that combining digital audio with laser disc technology would be a great improvement upon the Dolby Cassette and the LP .

The next day Walter Miller of the Edison Company was asked whether all the musical records he sent would have the title on the end of the cylinder ,  as they had seen arranged at the laboratory the day before ,  to which he replied ,  Yes sir ,  they will be fixed up that way .  However ,  it was not to be ;  the Edison company preferred to market the phonograph as a dictation machine ,  and nearly a decade went by before cylinder moulding became a commercial reality .  In the meantime , Berliner 's first <head>disc</head> records were made in Germany , and these definitely had labels of a sort ( 25 , 26 ) . The only doubt concerns the date ;  it seems these early records could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 ,  so whether Edison or Berliner was actually first to make records with a label is open to debate .  The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,  since there was insufficient flat space .

This was enforced by a system of adhesive stamps ,  the value of which was calculated to provide a royalty of five per cent of the retail cost of the record  ( see 31c )  .

It was normal practice for the trademark to occupy the upper half of the design ,  while the title and other details occupied the lower half .  The exceptions are sufficiently rare to be worth a study on their own ;   it was quite a challenge for designers to make effective use of a relatively small circular area with a hole in the middle .  The challenge became even greater with the advent of 45rpm <head>discs</head> , which had to be provided with an optional centre no less than an inch and a half in diameter for quick - acting autochange and juke - box mechanisms . Designers therefore could not use the middle of the label to carry vital information .

The idea was to sit the listener in the middle of a square array of loudspeakers ,  so sound would come at him from all corners  despite the fact that most live performances of music take place in front of the listener .  Most consumers had bought stereo equipment by then ,  and equipment manufacturers saw quadraphony as a golden opportunity to cash in on sales of new records ,  pickups ,  amplifiers ,  and loudspeakers .  Much effort was expended in squeezing four channels of sound onto an LP <head>disc</head> , and there were four incompatible systems , none of which worked very well . There seemed to be two areas of subject - matter where quadraphonics might have an artistic advantage ,  drama and wildlife recording ,  so it seemed very sensible when the first quadraphonic record of birdsong was announced .  However ,  it was not possible to get any quadraphonic effect from the record ,  no matter which system was tried .

Three factors  ( size ,  speed ,  and groove - pitch )  might be manipulated to make long - playing records .

Probably the first long - playing <head>disc</head> records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ; they were twenty inches in diameter . The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .

At the outside edge of a twelve - inch 78rpm record ,  the groove travels under the stylus at about 47 inches per second .  At the end of the record ,  when the stylus is approaching the label ,  the groove is travelling at about twenty inches per second ,  yet the sound quality is very similar .  Why not make the groove move at twenty inches per second throughout the whole <head>disc</head> ? This means starting the record at about 33rpm ,  and speeding it up gradually as the stylus travels in .  Pemberton - Billing 's  invention comprised an add - on governor mechanism which could be attached to a clockwork turntable to give this  effect  ( 49 )  ,  and a few dozen records were made which more than doubled the average playing - time .

There is a good Irish collection at Magee College  ,  and Belfast  has strong collections on art and design ,  including exhibition catalogues .  Other forms of recorded knowledge , such as microfilm , tape and <head>disc</head> recordings , film strips , slides and videotapes are kept in the library . In particular ,  there are significant microfilm collections at Jordanstown  and Coleraine  and 30,000 slides at Belfast  .  A modern library makes extensive use of information technology and it is frequently the case that students are tentative in making full use of such technology or are unaware of the wide range of services available .

Video - recording can be used ,  as with films ,  to create an atmosphere of reality and convey moving images ,  but these are requirements seldom met with in library instruction .  Short video - recorded programmes might well be used to illustrate lectures ,  as a means of creating interest .  Video - recording can make use of tape , film or <head>discs</head> for the actual storage of the recorded material . One of the problems facing libraries in the use of video material has been the lack of standardization between different systems .  It would appear that cassette systems are easier to use ,  as audio - cassettes ,  in library education .

All might still have been well were it not for the rupture - discs on the vents above the reactor .  Moeri considered these discs unnecessary for his low - pressure reaction ,  but he says Givaudan insisted on them because they were fashionable on all their equipment at the time .  Rupture - <head>discs</head> , however , simply open and let all the pressure escape . If proper security valves ,  which close after initial pressure is dissipated ,  had been used the pollution would have been much less ,  says Moeri .  Moeri 's  account of the accident could have a profound effect on the defence the company makes at the trial ,  which resumes on 11 May .

In the article on his work which appeared in 1985 Levi is at one point examined with reference to Leviticus .  She takes exception to a story of his about a Jewish Communist ,  an inhabitant of the camps ,  who  fasts there on Yom Kippur .  She observes that the prisoner is following a prohibition laid down in the Old Testament , but that a rabbinical ruling had allowed Jews to <head>eat</head> in the camps on Yom Kippur in order to stay alive . It is not clear why this is a reproach to Levi ,  whose story concerns a man whose piety is idiosyncratic ,  especially severe .  Two years after this ,  in February 1987 ,  she praised a Gulag memoir by Gustav Herling .

These statements are from The Wrench  ,  where Faussone is good at his job and Levi is good at getting this across .

Faussone talks about the way we bent our elbows an expression ( for <head>eating</head> or drinking ) which I have heard spoken in English , but which I had never before seen written down in a book . Book - writers ,  Faussone says ,  produce works which may be beautiful and all that ,  but ,  on the other hand ,  even if they were a bit defective ,  excuse the expression ,  nobody would die ,  and the only loser is the customer who bought them .  I have heard that before too ,  but not from any writer .

ACADEMY MENU WAS BLAND AND FAT - LADEN I AM staggered that Frances Bissell should have chosen to praise the Academy of Culinary Arts/Charles Heidsieck awards menu  (  Caterer  Hotelkeeper  ,  2228 August )  .

Therefore the restaurant manager and other front - of - house staff must use their skill to talk enthusiastically and intelligently about the menu so that customers will appreciate what the chef is producing ,  and dare to be adventurous .

This was a case of Gentlemen versus Players in the golden age when such distinctions still applied and when it was obvious to anyone with an eighth of an intelligence that no paid journeyman could ever begin to compare with the rapier - like amateurs who flitted with effortless superiority ,  solving one crime after another with a brilliant insouciance which was the dismay of the criminal fraternity ,  the envy of the constabulary ,  and a source of immense satisfaction to most of the upper middle class ,  especially those with an aptitude for the Times  crossword .  So when the great lady detective drew a hair from her head and stuck it across the lock on the front door of Sir Vivien 's  motor car ,  Constable Quince said nothing .  And when the great gentleman detective got hold of the village postman and subjected him to an interrogation which ranged from what he had <head>eaten</head> for breakfast to whether or not he possessed a wireless set and if so what he had listened to on the previous morning , Sergeant Bramble maintained a stoic countenance . At luncheon all four of them fetched up in the saloon bar of The Rose and Crown .  A great detective might have considered this an astounding coincidence were it not for the fact that the hostelry was the only place in the whole of King 's  Magnum Parva where a lady or a gentleman might obtain a meal .

The length of time for these processes to occur is very short  ( up to 6 seconds )  .  After this the energy is supplied by the breakdown of muscle glycogen into lactic acid .  Glycogen is produced from complex carbohydrate , and therefore the energy required for training is ultimately derived from the complex carbohydrates you <head>eat</head> . It is possible to break down fat to use as energy when you are training ,  but it is essentially glycogen which is the energy source .  In order to ensure that enough glycogen is present for training ,  carbohydrates should make up approximately half of your daily diet .

A proper discussion of a football match cannot occur if one of the participants is quite ignorant of the rules of the game ;  and the kind of assessment of a restaurant meal that would involve the possible insertion of the establishment into a good food guide  ( or perhaps its deletion from it )  will not get very far if one of the diners does not care for the meal because his idea of a gastronomic treat is a cheeseburger and french fries  ( though within the order of the burger discriminations are possible )  .

HALF THE pleasure of a southern Chinese meal ought to be the rice ;  its humble utility need not obscure its noble worth .  Traditionally ,  the fan ,  the cooked rice ,  is the essential element of the Chinese meal prepared south of the Yangtze River ;  north of the Yangtze ,  breads and noodles take its place .  The function of the cai , or choy whatever else might be <head>eaten</head> with the staple is to supply a little variety and additional nourishment . The finest rice in all China used to be grown in fields around the village of Shatin ,  in Hong Kong 's  New Territories .  So distinctive were its qualities that the entire crop was bought by the Imperial Court .

Ideally ,  it will be long - grained ,  rich in taste and slightly sticky .  The grains will be chewy ,  much as pasta should be al dente ;  it will be without lumps ;  and it will be fragrant .  It can be <head>eaten</head> without inhibition , the bowl raised to the lips and the chopsticks used to rake the grains into the mouth . About the only serious mistake you can make with rice is to stick your chopsticks upright in the bowl :  to do so mimics the Buddhist ritual for offerings to the dead ,  and will quickly reduce your table to an awkward silence .  The autumn winds have risen ,  The snakes are in good form ,  It 's  time to nourish yourself .

British fishermen are beginning to use lines rather than nets ,  but they are selling to the Continent because they 'd be daft not to .  It must sometimes be the case that I bring British fish back to London ,  but it will probably be in better condition than if it had been bought there as foreign agents insist on good transport and packing .

Critical response to the actor - director 's  hugely - hyped Henry V was distinctly mixed .  Saddest disappointment is Branagh himself  ( who )  proves a curiously anodyne screen presence .

The banks agree not to sell bonds below the issue price until the arranger of the issue is satisfied that the bulk of the deal has been sold ,  after which ,  members of the group are free to sell at whatever prices they wish .

This they frequently do , <head>eating</head> into , and more often devouring , the commissions they receive from the issuer . At the root of the problems with the old system was cut - throat competition .  Not ,  however ,  the old story of too many banks chasing too little commission income ;  compared to most markets ,  conventional Eurobond commissions are very generous .

One of his students at Simmons was the daughter of Frank Francis ,  Director of the British Museum ,  and this led to close contacts with the printing and publishing world in Britain .  From 1957 Rollo and his wife Alice came to London every year ,  where he was elected an honorary member of the Double Crown Club  ( whom he addressed ,  on WA Dwiggins )  and the Wynkyn de Worde Society .  Friendships made in this country were warmly reciprocated by the Silvers in their beautiful old house in Mt Vernon Street in Boston , where they lived an elegant and simple life : they never owned a car , and never cooked in their kitchen ; all meals except breakfast were <head>eaten</head> in restaurants . Rollo loved being taken to the gilt and plush ambience of Rules in Covent Garden ,  to which his riposte was Lock - Obers in Boston ,  which he protested was not so good .  Rollo Silver was old - fashioned in the best of ways ,  and a warm friend of the book world .

But though the camera may be at gut level ,  a cerebral decision has placed it there ,  and it is characteristic of Greenaway that he should stylise a major element of his film in this way .  For this most unspontaneous of artists ,  it is better to have a bad reason for something  a tenuous or cabbalistic reason  than to depend on chance ,  subjectivity and the moment .  Of course , only a sensibility that is accustomed to seeing food largely in still lifes can be surprised , as Greenaway seems to be , by the revelation that food , whether <head>eaten</head> or not , eventually by digestion or rot comes to look less good . This is a particular case of a general rule about Greenaway 's  films :  that only a person as obsessionally preoccupied with formal patterns as the director  and that is a tall order  can properly share his shock when death turns out not to be deterred by lists and games after all .  More moderate temperaments ,  to whom the patterning seemed a sort of death in the first place ,  are apt to remain stubbornly cheerful .

We can <head>eat</head> British produced eggs with confidence . The challenge now for the egg industry is to communicate this message to consumers ;  to look forward to the 1990s with confidence in the knowledge that its product is the best in the world  not to waste time and money on the constant examination of its collective navel and on cries of not fair .  Assuming the Daventry nuns have been subject only to the same controls being applied to all other British egg producers ,  the protest by the United Kingdom Egg Producers '  Association  ( Ukepra )  ,  the only organisation within the UK egg industry not represented among BEIC members ,  is potentially damaging both to egg consumers and to egg producers .

The peasant revolt that broke out in February 1921 in the Tambov guberniia threatened to cut off rail connections between Moscow and the Volga region ,  since hungry peasants held up wheat trains and ransacked them .  Bolshevik sources reveal that about half the population of the guberniia did not have enough to eat by then ,  and the position was no better by spring  of 1922 .  The revolt was squashed , but Tambov peasants in 1922 were still compelled to pay a levy on the acorns they picked to <head>eat</head> as a substitute for bread . The economic plight of the Volga peasantry was even more crippling than that of the Tambov or Ukrainian population .  There was no fear of revolt in the countryside on the Volga ,  due to sheer exhaustion .

The fourth characteristic of each of the three countries is that they have had the luck to avoid the worst of the droughts which have badly affected agriculture and hydro - electric power supplies in many African countries in the 1970s and 1980s .  While the north of Cameroun has been badly affected ,  its key productive areas lie in the high rainfall zones of the western highlands ;  in Kenya the old colonial rule - of - thumb that one year in five will be a year of drought has been sustained ,  and lean years have been followed by bumper crops .  In Botswana , the negative effects of low rainfall years are offset by the consequent increased sale of livestock , much of which is exported to high - value EC markets , since Botswana 's urban meat - <head>eating</head> population is small . Do these three relatively successful countries provide any kind of signpost to the rest of Africa ?  The answer can be only a muted yes since the economic foundations of most African countries ,  and the size and distribution of their population is very different to the situation prevailing in the early 1960s .

The only issues to be explored systematically are those of negotiating access  ( for example ,  Fox and Lundman 1974 ;  Holdaway 1982 )  ,  and the effects of gender on practice in the field  ( for example ,  Easterday et al  .  1977 ;  Hunt 1984 ;  Warren 1988 ;  Warren and Rasmussen 1977 )  .  However , until very recently , the leading ethnographers of the police made few disclosures on the difficulties they <head>encountered</head> , implying that their entry into the field and relations with police officers were unproblematic . Although often studying less controversial forces than the RUC ,  this panglossian portrayal has to be disbelieved ,  especially as the authors often indicated in an occasional footnote ,  or in a revealing preface or aside ,  that they faced problems in the field similar to our own  ( for example ,  see van Maamen 1981 :  479 ,  492 ;  Westley 1970 ,  p. vii )  ,  even when the research was covert  ( Holdaway 1982 ,  1983 :  12 )  .  The only exception to this is the discussion of the likely reactive effect caused by the presence of observers  ( McCall 1975 ;  Policy Studies Institute 1983b :  1115 ;  Reiss 1971 ;  Softley 1980 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1986 ;  Steer 1980 )  ,  although no serious doubt is put on the validity of observational data on the police .

On one level ,  it did not prevent some respondents expressing disparaging remarks about Catholics ,  nor dissuade them from giving opinions on controversial political issues .  On a deeper level ,  however ,  as we shall see in later chapters ,  the identity category Catholic is ,  for the majority of policemen and women ,  not an all - inclusive typification in which every Catholic is categorized alike .  Most members of the RUC we <head>encountered</head> used an interpretative process which contains a set of typifications for distinguishing between good and bad Catholics , as for good and bad people generally . Once the field - worker was categorized as conforming to their typification of a good Catholic  ( the meaning of which we will outline elsewhere )  ,  then her religion was no longer as important as it appears at first sight ,  although the extent to which it had a residual effect is impossible to estimate .  But it only remained of crucial importance to that small minority of bigoted constables who classify all Catholics as equally evil and nefarious .

Police work involves so much bloody paperwork these days and a lot of boring stuff that a family row can quite spice up a night .  ( FN 4/12/86 ,  pp. 23 )  In contrast , the effect of dealing with domestic disputes can be traumatic on some policemen as they momentarily place their own children and family in the situation of emotional horror they <head>encounter</head> . However ,  it is generally the case that violence against women provokes no strong emotion in policemen .  Faragher  ( 1985 )  found that police in Great Britain downgraded the seriousness of violence  against women in the home ,  for although formal regulations state that it is to be treated as an arrestable offence ,  policemen often redefined the incident as lying outside law enforcement  ( emphasized by Policy Studies Institute 1983b :  64 )  .

It would have been more accurate to say that all policemen and women should have such a role ,  for unfortunately many do not  ( see Trojanowicz and Pollard 1986 )  .  It was an attitude like this which made the individual transfer to community relations in the first place ,  as all those in Easton 's  Community Relations Unit did ,  one even from the Traffic Branch .  This self - selection process ensures that the Community Relations Branch attracts people with enthusiasm and the necessary personal qualities which make them enjoy work with youngsters , and not one member of the Community Relations Branch we <head>encountered</head> in Easton and elsewhere expressed anything other than pleasure and enjoyment from working with youngsters . Such enthusiasm makes them appear eccentric compared to policemen and women on the sections .  The marginality they experience within the force might lead them to exaggerate their job satisfaction ,  but this cuts both ways ,  for the unpopularity of community relations among many ordinary members of the RUC guarantees it will not appeal to any but the committed ,  and section duties already afford the work - shy many opportunities to hide .

Human existence ,  for Marx and Engels ,  occurs in terms of people 's  concepts ,  which are incorporated in their mode of life and their subjective experience ,  but it is from man 's  interaction with nature and from the history of this interaction that these ideas ,  beliefs ,  and values are created in the first place .  The argument runs like this :  at any particular time people apprehend natural material circumstances through their ideas ,  and they  therefore act in terms of these ideas ,  beliefs ,  and values .  Therefore , in history it is not nature and technology which makes human society but it is man himself , who in terms of his already existing ideas and values , makes his own history , as he <head>encounters</head> nature and the problems it poses . These already existing ideas and values are ,  however ,  themselves the product of previous encounters and answers to the challenge of nature .  This means that the relation of ideas and practical problems can only be understood as part of the process of history .

So it is not implausible for critics to say that the solid - state detectors are unreliable and somehow bring about a sharp distortion in the spectra .

A genuine but mundane antiquity can have its value increased enormously by the addition of a unique feature ,  or of a historical association such as a royal cipher .  Given the complexity of many of the objects ,  and the almost endless possibilities of treatment that could have befallen them ,  the scientist needs the collaboration of the art historian ,  in addition to a very wide experience of antiquities and knowledge of the technical processes of the past ,  in order to reconstruct as much as possible of a particular object 's  background history .  Some of the scientific methods and problems <head>encountered</head> are exemplified below by specific case histories . The main approaches to the scientific detection of fakes are :  the study of composition and methods of construction to see if they match the supposed age of the object ;  examination for evidence of aging ,  such as the formation of a patina ;  and the application  of archaeological dating techniques ,  which can at least give an indication of age and in some cases an actual date .

Not all of the major groups will be described here ,  but only those that are likely to be found by the non - specialist collector .  Some important groups , like the mosses and liverworts , have a sporadic fossil record extending back to the Carboniferous , but they are not likely to be <head>encountered</head> without a special search . Plant fossils are often to be found in particular beds ,  reflecting conditions of deposition that were just right for their preservation .  Of course ,  the rocks that contain abundant plant remains are mostly those which were deposited in freshwater lakes ,  or on deltas ,  or the fossilized remains of peat beds .

The horsetails reproduce by means of spores ,  which are born in small cone - like structures at the tip of the branches or on modified shoots .  They are among the easiest of fossil plants to recognize ,  for even flattened stems retain the characteristic jointing ,  and the feathery distal branches cannot be mistaken for anything else .  The flattened whorls are particularly easy to recognize , and are frequently <head>encountered</head> in the soft , dark shales associated with coal seams . As with so many of the primitive plants the arthrophytes had their heyday in the Carboniferous after a probable origin in the Devonian .  Because they are common in aquatic environments they have a rather good fossil record ,  and are not uncommon in freshwater sediments of Jurassic and Cretaceous age .

Tropical forests are complex but in temperature at least ,  are constant from month to month .  What all these tropical forests have in common ,  however ,  is their astonishing biological diversity .

Yet it is only in the past decade that biologists have begun to appreciate the real extent of it .

Given that this is so ,  what sense can we make of the way in which God ,  as opposed to John or Jane Smith ,  is personal ?  What sense can be made of divine as opposed to human personality ?

Clearly a great deal of what religious traditions have to say about the Deity presupposes a personal God .  We think of a being who shows various emotions towards creation  love ,  wrath ,  anger ,  sorrow ,  mercy and so on  and who is associated with particular activities that we think of as actions taken by persons ,  such as judgement .

On 17 December Reynolds and his wife Anne ,  with Blake safely hidden away ,  left Britain on the Dover ferry to Ostend ,  drove across Belgium to West Germany and thence to a border crossing - point with East Germany where they arrived on 19 December .  Here Blake left them ,  identified himself to the surprised border guards and a few days later was flown to  Mosow  for a triumphant reunion with the KGB .  Travelling on a false passport made out in the name of James Richardson , Bourke travelled by train from London to Paris ( apparently without <head>encountering</head> any problems with the police who were searching for him ) , and thence by air to Berlin where he crossed into the eastern sector and shortly afterwards was flown to Moscow to be reunited with Blake . Bourke did not enjoy his time in Russia and on 23 October 1968 returned to his native Ireland .  The British government attempted to extradite Bourke for his part in helping Blake escape but after a long legal wrangle this was rejected by the Irish courts .

Many of the indicators chosen are suspect ,  as Macnicol has shown for earlier periods ,  in that they simply count contact with state agencies ,  and it is a commonplace observation that the poor are more likely to be in contact with social workers because they are poor  ( Becker ,  1988 )  ;  young drug - takers in inner cities are more visible than wealthy socialites but drug - taking and drinking stretch across social groups  ( O'Bryan ,  1989 ;  Plant ,  1989 )  ;  desertion of women by husbands and the choice to remain unmarried are not restricted to the poor ;  and so on and so on .  All these signs of inadequacy are nothing of the kind but are indicators of poverty and powerlessness .  Only measures of material social conditions , unemployment , income , housing conditions , density of population , can usefully serve to characterize the deprivation <head>encountered</head> by those forced to live in these circumstances . The underclass is what the working poor become when they are not employed .

Keats placed him among the stars ,  where Keats himself ,  for similar reasons ,  was to be placed by Shelley .

Readers can be <head>expected</head> to spot which of these quotations are forgeries , and they must also have doubted in their time whether this writer was as good as the early tributes made out . It seems clear ,  however ,  that Chatterton needn't have had prodigious talent for the talent expended in the novel to take effect .  It is a novel which communicates the notion that talented and untalented meet in that country of the mind where everyone copies and steals from everyone else ,  where everything is reproductive or reminiscent of everything else ,  where one thing leads to another and this person passes into that .

All knowledge of life and lives ,  and indeed of history ,  is a good in itself ,  and seems likely to inform literary intelligence ;  and in addition Amis 's  novels would rather confuse if thought to be the work of an early Tudor writer .

Kenner 's fantasy is being discussed in terms of the view with which Kenner can be <head>expected</head> to be very familiar that the goals of a biographically - minded criticism are in some measure fantastic . Beyond this ,  however ,  leaves indefinite the point at which ,  or frequency with which ,  the use of biography deserves to be called by that name .  She is saying that this good thing ,  this knowledge ,  can be used  to tell us ,  for example ,  that Amis  is not a Tudor writer :  but she is rather more moved to say at the same time that it ca n't or can hardly be used ,  devoted as she is to the thought of a separation between ,  in this case ,  Amis 's  friendships and politics ,  his life  and his art .

She says ,  too ,  you have to relate the mental intention to the physical action .

This means that actors are <head>expected</head> to be able to control any regional or foreign accent which is natural to them , and deliver a text in what may best be called the classical style . It does n't mean that your regional accent is going to be bullied out of you ,  so that you are unable to use it ever again  on the contrary ,  your accent may in all probability be your most interesting and valuable possession .

One explicit guiding principle of papal teaching which came to influence the Irish constitution and successive debates culminating in the church  state imbroglio of 1951 ,  dealt with below ,  was that of subsidiarity :  that no secondary institution such as the state should take on duties which primary and intermediate ones ,  such as the family ,  could assume .  Secondary institutions were also <head>expected</head> to assist primary ones in fulfilling their essential tasks . The principle took on particular importance in the light of the development of totalitarian communism ,  and the Roman church saw the threat to be endemic in the growth of the modern state apparatus ,  including its welfare institutions .  It is also important to notice how easily such a principle supports personal enterprise and property in its contemporary form ,  capitalism .

there must be ,  there has to be a separation between Church and State and we totally endorse and emphatically reiterate that ,  but the separation between Church and State does not mean a separation between conscience and the electorate 's  responsibility in voting .

Pabulum Consultants '  Jennifer Rust comments :  Many companies will only invest in the minimum training required to get the system up and running ;  it is not surprising in these cases that the systems are not being used to their full potential .  Management should regard a full training schedule as part of the total cost of the system and include this total sum in the system 's  payback calculations .  The computer system will only bring the returns that the company <head>expects</head> if the people using it are using the system fully , which can be guaranteed through investment in adequate training . It must also be noted that the computer systems generate information and it is how this information is used that influences the returns on the total package .  The onus is on the company to ensure that staff are making intelligent decisions on the information that the computer system provides and this comes from in - house training .

Susceptibility to high g is greatly affected by the duration of the loading ,  and whereas most people can cope with 3 to 4 g for a few seconds ,  a sustained loading of that amount may cause loss of vision .

Much also depends on the seating positions and whether the pilot is <head>expecting</head> the extra g and prepares for it by tensing himself up.

It is normal for this sensitivity to remain for a few flights and then gradually to disappear .  After a little more flying experience ,  beginners '  eyes interpret what is happening to the aircraft and the alarm signal is no longer sent on to the brain .  For example , as the stick is moved forwards a little , the eyes see the nose of the glider moving down , and the brain <head>expects</head> the sensation and understands what is happening . As there is no cause for alarm ,  the brain suppresses the sensation at source .  This is another reason to start off any flying training by emphasising visual references instead of the instruments .

He must come to terms with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problems he will face in revealing this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account .  Moreover ,  he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,  perhaps without thinking ,  which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it <head>expects</head> a degree of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world ,  where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil ,  the  objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act .  In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .

.  Again Douglas  ( 1966 :  138 )  has suggested there is a liaison which exists between the physical body and its use as an expression of the social ,  so that one becomes a paradigm for the other :  the human body is a model which can stand for any bounded system .  It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that a well - disciplined human body with clearly defined parameters of correctness will provide a symbolic mirror of the  preferred police social formation in which the human condition can be enacted .  We can also <head>expect</head> to find that any discrepancy in this preferred social formation will be reflected and transferred to the physical body as a metaphor of chaos . These adjacent police forces were physically aberrant in nuance of bodily style and were therefore deemed to be socially incorrect .  In their metaphorical indiscipline they had gained new status and slipped across a boundary into marginality ,  for as Foucault  ( 1977 :  25 )  has suggested ,  the idea of discipline revolves around control of the physical body and proceeds from the distribution of individuals in space it is always the body that is at issue  the body and its forces ,  their utility and their docility ,  their distribution and their punishment .

What is important is how humans react to it .  You should not tolerate your dog doing something you feel strongly against .  Also , if you allow the dog to sit on your settee , then replace that settee with a new one you do n't want the dog to sit on , you must not <head>expect</head> it to suddenly understand why it cannot sit there .

On the other hand ,  there are those who have only an imperfect formal competence in a language but  who by a combination of guesswork and intuition can somehow make contact with the aesthetic qualities of a foreign poem .

For those who do not have much real competence in other languages ,  there is the possibility of coming to terms with poems in the older ,  more remote forms of English .

The other emerges when he remarks in the opening lines the regular yet halting rhythm ,  the smooth uncertainty of movement which may either proceed to greater regularity or fall away into improvisation .  This perception is picked up later ,  more than once ,  as Tate moves through the poem :  subtly and imperceptibly the rhythm has changed ,  there is constant and sudden change of rhythm ,  a broken and distracted rhythm .  If we read Ash - Wednesday through with Tate 's commentary at our elbow , we see at any given point what he means : he has a good ear , as we might <head>expect</head> from his own poems ( which are however metrical , as Ash - Wednesday is n't ) . And we may agree that what binds together the six parts of Ash - Wednesday is in large part something rhythmical .  It remains true that in Tate 's  criticism and since  ( for no advance has been made in this quarter )  rhythm and movement are wholly impressionistic  you hear what the critic is talking about ,  or else you do n't .

The deal will lift its share of the Spanish soft drinks market from 8 to 10 per cent and of the Portuguese market from 3 to 8 per cent .  The price paid for the acquisition ,  including a fruit plant near Valencia and a bottling plant in Barcelona ,  appears high since the businesses being acquired had sales of 29.6m in 1988 and trading profits of 2.2m ,  implying a p/e on conventional terms of almost 30 .

Writing as he was in the 1930s , he <head>expressed</head> his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art , instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching . If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .

Another famous figure ,  Joan Mir ,  initially praised by Breton as the most Surrealist painter ,  later described his Surrealist phase as having lasted only for a matter of months .  A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in writing criticism ,  as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others .  This places a critic in a privileged position , but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views <head>expressed</head> are those of the critic or those of the artist . This distinction can be limpid if the artist is directly interviewed ,  and the interview is verbatim ;  but there are problems of evidence with filming and tape recordings ,  as well as with interviews ,  since the viewer or reader is unlikely to know how they have been edited .

More and more the struggle to <head>express</head> it intensified . Matisse and all the others saw the twentieth century with their eyes but they saw the reality of the nineteenth century ,  Picasso was the only one in painting who saw the twentieth century with his eyes and saw its reality and consequently his struggle was terrifying ,  terrifying for himself and for the others ,  because he had nothing to help him ,  the past did not help him ,  nor the present ,  he had to do it all alone and ,  in spite of much strength he is often very weak ,  he consoled himself and allowed himself to be seduced by other things which led him more or less astray .

The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .  An extremist view <head>expressed</head> by a twentieth - century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto . When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .

And they will undoubtedly object to the more unbridled formulations that enter the three fictions ;  the biography of Eliot has plenty to say on the subject ,  too ,  while maintaining a comparative ,  and suitable ,  reserve .  They wo n't accept with Charles Wychwood that everything is copied ,  and wo n't accept his opinion of Chatterton :  Thomas Chatterton believed that he could explain the entire material and spiritual world in terms of imitation and forgery ,  and so sure was he of his own genius that he allowed it to flourish under other names .  The second half of this can be seen to coincide with the opinion of Chatterton which is <head>expressed</head> by Ackroyd 's Wilde : a strange , slight boy who was so prodigal of his genius that he attached the names of others to it . Peter Ackroyd has here performed the not impossible feat of plagiarising himself  while leaving the reader in doubt as to whether the writer shares this implausible estimate of Chatterton 's  marvellous buoyancy .  As Ackroyd 's  ventriloquised Wilde makes clear ,  Wilde was a great exaggerator and ,  like his friend Whitman ,  a great contradictor of himself ;  and he is certainly a great source of dualistic formulations ,  in all their slippery bliss .

The shifting consensus of church and state was not the major feature of the period .

They were both cases <head>expressing</head> the consensus of politician and priest . The major debates after that time have tended to show a split between church leadership and a large section of its laity on the one hand ,  and a significant proportion of Roman catholic laity ,  other churches ,  and secular groups on the other.

The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions The new Ireland must be a society within which , subject only to public order , all cultural , political and religious beliefs can be freely <head>expressed</head> and practised . This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time ,  the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist parties in Ireland ,  representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population ,  had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will .

Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,  the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .  Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .

Expansion of the work of the Court of Protection is favoured but if this is not thought appropriate then some form of locally accessible tribunal or court to exercise supervision ,  possibly supplemented by some form of guardianship ,  is considered desirable .

In it he expressed his own and his dancers '  sheer enjoyment of just dancing to music which cries out to be danced .  That passionate love of music as movement is what Rachmaninov 's  Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini  is all about .  To have heard Rachmaninov play hisown or any other Russian music or to listen to his orchestral works is to realise he was a passionate musician , loving his art and giving his all to <head>express</head> the joys and sorrows , the tender and brutal moods and all the emotions to which man is subject . In composing the Rhapsody  ,  Rachmaninov tried to vary the Paganini theme as much as  possible by differentiating the instrumental sections one from another .  Whereas Symphonic Variations  flows onwards in simple serenity ,  Ashton ,  following Rachmaninov ,  here uses an enormous variety of steps and constantly changes the choreographic phrasing to reflect the increasing or diminishing sounds and to match the tempi of the melody ,  in order to give his enchanements  light and shade and to indicate the sheer complexity of the orchestration .

There are other ways in which choreographers can be guided by the musical context other than those already cited .  When inspired by Tchaikovsky 's  Fifth Symphony to create Les Frsages   ( 1933 )  ,  Massine took a theme which proposed that Man would win his struggle against fate if he had Action ,  Love and Frivolity on his side .  The moods and emotions of each were <head>expressed</head> in the first three movements . In the fourth ,  Man ,   with the help of the three soloists from the other movements ,  overcame the bat - like figure representing Fate .  Massine took this theme from Tchaikovsky 's  own letters to his patron in which he described a composer 's  search for ideas .

The Listeners  ( The Royal Ballet )  The romantic style The romantic style is the most poetic of all because its movements must <head>express</head> moods , emotions and actions that are reactions to the circumstances and events which surround and occur to characters during the unfolding of plot , theme or music There are two kinds of romantic ballet .  firstly ,  there are ballets of the older type which depict the struggle between the world of the flesh and the world of the spirit and which were usually inspired by a fairy tale or legend ,  e.g. La Sylphide  and Giselle  .

He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot ,  especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour ,  idiosyncrasies ,  etc. ,  for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet  .  Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will <head>express</head> the moods , emotions and actions of the characters they play . This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot ,  to create a changing atmosphere and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play ,  dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements  .

No better example of such objectivity was Ashton 's  own playing of the Onlooker in Nocturne  .  He stood silent and still ,  watching the tragedy of the Poor Girl who was being rejected by the Rich Man .  His two tiny gestures said everything and <head>expressed</head> the audience 's understanding of the plot . He made one as if he should try and comfort her ,  but turned away ,  walked upstage and on the balcony with his back to the audience ,  raised his arms widely only to drop them helplessly .  No one could fail to understand the Onlooker 's  reaction to the tale just unfolded .

They must also be performed and co - ordinated with the occupational gestures that belong to the location and that are employed by the particular inhabitants whose story ,  with its moods ,  emotions and actions ,  is being told .  This means that natural emotional expression must also be folded into the design .  This is probably the most difficult material to handle because the many characters and nationalities involved in the various available libretti must <head>express</head> themselves as distinctively as they do in real life and the choreographer must try and ensure his design has some semblance of reality if it is to communicate meaning . It was in this particular field of difficulty that Balanchine sometimes showed his deep understanding .  In his abstract ballets or interpretations of music ,  he rarely worried about the mood or emotional content of the music .

With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the difference in photon energy  (  E '  E = hf '  hf  )  of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity  (  v  )  acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon .  The extra energy not being allowed to be <head>expressed</head> as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f , that is : ( formula included ) where m is the photon equivalent mass ( yes I know it is related to E but I am trying not to confuse myself ) , E is the energy , and h is Mr Plank 's claim to fame .

THE IDEA that the Warsaw Pact would be able to mount a surprise attack on Nato will shortly be barely plausible because of the unilateral troop cuts started nine months ago by the Kremlin ,  according to experts at the London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies .  John Cross ,  speaking at a press conference to mark the publication yesterday of The Military Balance 1989 - 90 ,  the institute 's  authoritative annual survey of world armed forces ,  said that the cuts under way in the Warsaw Pact do tend to support Soviet claims of new thinking .  Conservative Western military analysts have <head>expressed</head> scepticism about Soviet statements that they are removing from their armed forces both the capability and the doctrine of a large - scale attack on western Europe . Francois Heisbourg ,  the institute 's  director ,  said that growing tensions between different members of the Warsaw Pact are undermining its ability to act as an alliance .  Although the east European states individually retain strong bi - lateral links with Moscow ,  he said ,  the differing attitudes to reform mean that there is clearly a group of countries who are no longer in alliance with another group .

This is the inarticulate prayer that is answered  ( we read in Philippians )  in the resurrection ,  the redemption of all human suffering ,  of all mortality .

For example ,  Manning  ( 1977 )  showed how policemen and women in the ranks have an ability to bypass or undermine innovations introduced by police managers ,  some even doing so while appearing to endorse the policy change  ( Chatterton 1979 )  .  Holdaway  ( 1977 )  documented the difficulties police managers in Hilton had in overcoming wellaccepted practices in order to introduce more professional police practice in the form of unit beat policing .  While advocates of community policing <head>express</head> confidence in its ability to effect improvements ( Alderson 1979 , 1982 ; Scarman 1981 ) , research contradicts this by pointing to resistance from those constables who are responsible for it or to organizational constraints ( Fielding et al . 1988 ;  Grimshaw and Jefferson 1987 ;  Trojanowicz and Harden 1985 )  ,  although there are a number of other studies which emphasize its success in overcoming public hostility to the police  ( Brown and Iles 1985 ;  McKane 1980 ;  cf. Cumberbatch 1983 ,  Taylor - Griffiths 1988 )  .  Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .

Certainly his resignation ensures that he will be in the clear when the economic roof falls in  an event which many people now regard as virtually inevitable .  The second aspect is the extent to which recent events prove that politicians should avoid <head>expressing</head> the obvious , because it always leads to trouble . Take ,  for instance ,  the brouhaha which has followed Mrs Thatcher 's  hint that she will probably retire sometime between the next general election and the one after that .  This was made the payoff in the Sunday Correspondent 's  interview with the PM ,  though it has since emerged that the sequence of the conversation was altered .

But lawyers <head>expressed</head> doubts . They were very negligent but they were not criminally negligent ,  said one barrister .  A manslaughter conviction would require proof of recklessness or ,  possibly ,  gross negligence .

This is why the CIA during the 50s and 60s covertly supported a multitude of initiatives whose aim was to present the new American Art across the world as a promise for the future .  Since the works  ( de Kooning apart )  were abstract they lent themselves to diverse interpretations .  In this way a mostly desperate body of art , which had at first shocked the American public , was transformed by speeches , articles and the context in which it was displayed , into an ideological weapon for the defence of Individualism and the right to <head>express</head> oneself . Pollock ,  I 'm sure ,  was unaware of this programme  he died too soon ;  nevertheless the propaganda apparatus helped to create the confusion surrounding his art after his death .  A cry of despair was turned into a Declaration for Democracy .

Despite the difficulties of getting into and travelling around many of these countries  due to poor roads ,  curfews ,  civil wars ,  monsoons  researchers often uncover information and testimony they would never otherwise obtain .

The government had not acknowledged their arrest but the team had <head>heard</head> rumours of the women 's whereabouts in a military camp and in fact found them there .

At the beginning of the book a dear friend ,  Charlie ,  another immigrant boy ,  leaves for Russia with his family  for the land ,  they hope ,  of the free .  Ralph strives to address the high heid yins of Russia to solicit news of the family ,  and receives his letter back from the Embassy in London ,  stamped :  Communication not permitted .  And the family was never <head>heard</head> of again . Glasser orders his events thematically ,  while also wanting to tell a story and to spring surprises .  Charlie 's  departure is the first of several ,  and this event is succeeded by the announcement of a further theme when the rabbi 's  thunderings pass over the heads of his congregation and the writer notes :  in later years I would wonder how different my life might have been if a few people ,  those closest to me ,  had  been frightened  just  a little .

In the days before glasnost   which his fictions may be thought to have rehearsed and predicted ,  but which could well mean that his fictions will no longer be for the West what they have been so far ,  when the thing that they deplore was still there in its entirety to be deplored  Kundera was forced into exile in the free world of the time .

With the franchise bids for Channel 3 close to completion and the date set for the advertising of Channel 5 franchises it is timely to look again at the possibilities in the new channel ,  and in particular at the potential for city television .  The arguments for the development of the media industries of regional cities has always had both economic and cultural aspects .

Despite the minimalist parameters for the new channel set out in the Broadcasting Act ,  in profound contrast to the remit of Channel Four when it began a decade ago ,  we want to make an issue of the new Channel .  We see the allocation of the scarce resource of our last terrestrial channel as a matter worth serious discussion ,  and seek in it an answer to the perceived shortcomings of the existing Channels .

Here ,  these have been laid in a bold panel close to the house and have also been used in strips and courses so that they tie the raised pool into  the overall design of the terrace .  The pool forms a real focal point from both the house and patio , while the sound of water , falling from a mask set in the wall , will be delightful on a <head>hot</head> summer 's day . Of course ,  if you have a young family and feel water might be a hazard ,  the feature could become a raised sandpit or planter ,  which naturally gives you the opportunity of converting it at a later stage .

No no ,  I have no head for it today .

And underneath these feelings he felt some <head>hot</head> , dark stirrings in himself . What were they ?  A desire to retaliate  against whom ?

He half - woke ,  and saw the window - square glimmering with the pallor of sunrise The river again ,  the far bank was nearer but here was a black smooth stretch ,  he half knew that he was dreaming ,  he wanted to stop the dream and he wanted to get across ,  if only he could raise his mouth and nostrils above the swell of the water He made himself wake finally and lay under the covers feeling weak and <head>hot</head> , as though he had been spending energy incessantly all night . Outside the day was fine enough ,  too clear perhaps ;  each roughness on the skyline was sharply visible ,  as though it might rain later .  Just now the autumnal coolth was tonic and he breathed it in like drinking draughts of fresh milk ,  then took dippersful of water from the butt at the side of the house and sluiced his head into activity .

A common modern technique is similar to guitar finger style using a CC - G - C or a similar fifth and octave tuning which gives greater versatility without re - tuning and can be further extended by the introduction of an extra fret between the 6th and 7th .  A good tutor book will explain this .  If the ribs ( sides ) are thinner , as suggested ( about 1.5mm ) <head>hot</head> bending will not be necessary and a better shape can be achieved by the use of a simple jig to hold the ribs while the glue dries . The use of small glue blocks along the inside of the joint is also a good idea .  If the instrument is to be resonant the apparently solid finger board needs to be hollowed out from underneath ,  leaving about 6mm of wood top and sides and openings cut through the soundboard  ( face )  to link this space to the interior of the instrument .

Hops thus contain both flavour and bittering components making them valuable ingredients in brewing .  Unfortunately releasing these into the wort requires mutually  incompatable  conditions .  Flavours rapidly evaporate from <head>hot</head> wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop . Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of adding copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour .  While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer ,  problems may be encountered .

A demonstration of the point is to compare Civilisation  by Kenneth Clark in its forms as television and book .

Nevertheless , the limitations of writing a script to accompany <head>images</head> on the screen become clear on the printed page . The pace of television favours simplifications ,  generalised statements ,  witticisms ,  and short sharp judgements on artists '  performances .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much interest attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical <head>image</head> of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Some are connected with writings about literature ,  philosophy and politics which are called post - modern or post - structural .  Post - structuralist texts expose the role of language in deferring meaning and in constructing a subjectivity which is not fixed but is constantly negotiated through a whole range of forces  economic ,  social and political .  They have undermined long - cherished views of the writer or artist as a unique individual creating in the <head>image</head> of divine creation ( in an unbroken chain that links father and son as in Michelangelo 's God reaching towards Adam in the Sistine Chapel frescoes ) , and the work of art as reducible to a single true meaning Now artistic intention can be seen more clearly as just one of many often overlapping strands  ideological ,  economic ,  social ,  political  that make up the work of art ,  whether literary text ,  painting ,  or sculpture .  The most difficult theoretical surveys are those which seem to promise to answer difficult questions about art in general ,  perhaps especially in the modern world .

Secondly ,  the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,  even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of difficulty arises in descriptions of works produced in far Eastern cultures .  While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking , as it were , through an <head>image</head> to what it represents or means , an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing , in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work . Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing .

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The <head>images</head> carry different information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

Nowadays ,  nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE  ( Theatre in Education )  tours .  In drama schools ,  improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses ,  which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time .  The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ; it still conjures up the traditional , hackneyed <head>image</head> of a student being asked to be a tree or an icecream . But it 's  possible to go way beyond these limited ,  obvious exercises ,  and impro can be immensely exciting for young actors ,  allowing them to grasp situations and emotions imaginatively ,  perhaps for the first time .  Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors :  An actor is asked to assume the character of a close family friend who arrives at the house with the news of the death of the wife 's  husband in an accident .

The Easter rising of 1916 as an act of national liberation ,  unquestioned in the dominant catholic  nationalist culture from 1922 until well into the 1960s and 1970s ,  still holds a cherished place in the hearts of the majority of the people .  It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .

This ,  so far as it concerns Leonard ,  simply goes too far .  He was not trying to organise anything !  He was speaking from a mind full of ideas and <head>images</head> , which all offered insight in varying ways , which he sought to reflect on over several years . It is placing an artificial ,  not to say architectonic ,  view on the whole work so to argue ;  it is to take his mythology too seriously ,  too literally ;  to fail to see that the excess was part of the message .  It is unfortunate that the influential Dudek could only illustrate Leonard 's  work by quoting from the admittedly despondent poem Rededication ,  without a reference to the many other elements of positive delight that the book  and Leonard 's  work elsewhere at that time  demonstrates .

That is the emphatic point ;  the tone of the book ,  its whole direction ,  is thereby established .  Mandel is right about its being unified powerfully ,  but the principle of unity centres on freedom ,  not the Sabbath ceremonies  ( intrinsic ,  as they are ,  to Leonard 's  conception of freedom )  ;  which merely protects   ( when allowed to do so )  that freedom .  The kite is the representative image of freedom , of which Scobie commented , it is one of Cohen 's most successful and most richly complex <head>images</head> ; which Ondaatje highlights as symbolic of our ego and our ambition , of all that is original and free in us .

Hume described Berkeley 's  attack on abstract ideas as the most important development of late in the republic of letters .

It is tempting to think of it as a felt  tendency ,  so that one is somehow aware of where the mind is going .  This will not do ,  for it is no different from saying that when one experiences red one thinks or conceives of the colour ,  whereas the point of the theory was to explain what such thinking ,  or conceiving ,  is .  It is similarly tempting to think of the colour <head>image</head> as hovering in the background , somehow anticipated by the mind ; but this is a metaphor , for the image either is or is not in consciousness . And ,  contrary to Hume 's  contention ,  being very dimly  in consciousness is not the same as being thought of .  The tendency of the mind to move from one thing to another has to consist in the straightforward fact that one thing usually follows ,  or is caused by ,  the other ;  the tendency or association cannot be thought of as some experienced  feature of the situation without reviving the original situation of having an unanalysed conception of the mind 's  ability to reach out and apprehend things .

From the point of view of the experiencing subject ,  the meaningfulness is not something of which he is conscious ;  all he experiences is ,  first the word red ,  then a mental image :  there is nothing that could count as his internally and introspectably associating them which does not reintroduce the mysterious generality of thought .  It does not help the associationist to press the concept of resemblance to his aid .  It might seem that it would , because it might seem very natural to think that one red thing or <head>image</head> might be taken as standing for red things in general because of its natural resemblance to the other members of the class , this constituting the most fundamental sort of association . But resemblance cannot explain how a thinker could experience one object as standing for another ;  for how could the fact that a particular  datum is similar to other things mean anything to a thinker unless he experienced it as  being like many others  that is ,  unless he grasped it ,  not just as a particular but as  an instance of a kind ?  But this is the very ability for which we are trying to account .

Use of line Designs composed of small masses of veneer forming a readable picture ,  correspond roughly in looks ,  if not in colour ,  to subjects as they actually appear to the eye ;  they seem to be in 3D even though they are flat ,  and to a degree they are naturalistic .  There is another branch of graphics , however , in which an <head>image</head> is produced by the use of line rather than mass . In its most basic form the technique involves merely an outline ,  or when it is filled in ,  a silhouette ;  but of course it can be much more elaborate than that .  Linear representation of solid form has always been a valid artistic technique ,  especially in drawing  ( as distinct from painting )  ,  and it can be used in marquetry work also provided the nature of the material  ( ie .  wood )  is not ignored .

Each memory block is called a bit plane ,  and supplies one of the bits needed for each pixel .  This is illustrated in Fig. 6 ,  showing typical mapping from the start of the four bit plane base addresses and the first line of pixels on the screen .  The main body of a bit <head>image</head> file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 . Bit image files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format .  One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,  bits per pixel ,  pixels per scan line ,  and the number of scan lines .

The modern printer is normally a bit - mapped device with a wide range of facilities .  Before printing a page ,  the printer 's  processor assembles a complete bit mapped image into its memory .  Like other graphics , fonts can be described in a high level manner , or as bit mapped <head>images</head> . Those stored in high level form are called outline or stroked fonts ,  and scale much more gracefully than bit image fonts ,  particularly to large sizes .

The Berkeley Square Gallery ,  for example ,  maintains a second outlet in Tokyo ,  as a vital part of its operations .  Japanese collectors find it easy to appreciate prints ,  because works on paper are very much part of their own cultural heritage .  They do not make the distinction between an <head>image</head> on canvas or panel and one on paper which seems so obvious indeed axiomatic to Europeans . They are aware of the fact that some of the greatest of their own artists  Hokusai ,  for instance ,  and Hiroshige  made print - making a primary creating medium .  Japanese collectors also value the psychological security offered by the multiple image  to like exactly what other collectors like seems to them a good and reassuring thing .

This is fairly easy to answer ,  but only with the proviso that a given conjunction of circumstances will set prices spiralling upward again .  A recent major commercial show of Miro 's  work ,  for example ,  took all his prices to a new high .  A big coloured <head>image</head> , such as the aptly named Le Samourai , will now cost 25,000 . Spectacular coloured Chagalls bring even more  up to 45,000 .  So do major prints by Sam Francis  ( who lived and worked for a while in Japan )  .

So do major prints by Sam Francis  ( who lived and worked for a while in Japan )  .  The benchmark here is over 50,000 .  Matisse and Picasso , who form the backbone of the market in classic modern prints , bring sums which depend both on the actual rarity of the <head>image</head> and its attractiveness . A beautiful odalisque by Matisse ,  such as Torso with a Jug ,  typical of the work he did in the 1920s and 1930s ,  will bring 35,000 or more .  Images from Picasso 's  eternally popular Vollard Suite ,  which dates from the early 1930s ,  bring between 8,000 and 12,000 plus  but these ,  though easy to like because of their smooth neo - classical style ,  are not coloured and were published in a fairly big edition .

Venturi 's  survey started with classical times ,  the uncertainties of writing by Xenocrates ,  lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles ,  and settled down to comment on  two fundamental categories of criticism ,  the lives of artists ,  and the critic 's  encounter with the work of art .  For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian ,  the second - century Greek rhetorician :  A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to express a judgement and to argue the reasons for what he sees .  For Venturi , an <head>important</head> development in art criticism came in the eighteenth century which saw the foundation of aesthetics and the rise of philosophies for which art was an indispensable ingredient . Writing as he was in the 1930s ,  he expressed his pleasure at the extensive documentation and reference material available to the student of art ,  instancing the growth of libraries and art historical teaching .  If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .

There will always be problems when working with an English vernacular text using cockney or other dialects ,  but students from overseas have to expect to take this in their stride  ( and usually do )  .  Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,  and find out what it 's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It 's <head>important</head> that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools . And with so much theatre training available in the United States ,  New Zealand ,  Australia and Canada ,  it is interesting to ask why  British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial .  I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK ,  although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors .

That is probably the most <head>important</head> question the panel are asking themselves . And the next thing will be what is his attitude to this audition  is it positive ?  Always remember that they have asked to see you and that is what they want to do .

There is no limit to the amount of grant available ,  but it will be offered for reasonable costs only .  If additional work ,  or special items such as gold taps are requested by you ,  then you will be expected to pay for these .  It is <head>important</head> to agree on , and understand the limit of the works that are being done before work starts . The Environmental Health Officer will however carry out a Financial Test of resources to determine how much ,  if anything ,  you are expected to pay towards the reasonable costs .  He/she will tell you how much this is at the beginning so you know at the start how much you have to pay .

How much can I covenant ?  Covenant payments are made out of your income and are not capital payments .  You could covenant all your taxable income if you wished remember though that a part of your total income will not be subject to tax , because of the various tax allowances you enjoy ( personal allowances , mortgage <head>interest</head> relief , etc. ) If you are planning to give a particularly large sum ,  it is always more advantageous to give out of income by covenant than to give a capital sum .  You can spread the payments over as long a period as you like .

The library user who looks for books of art criticism is not necessarily going to have an easy task .  Let us picture a girl entering through the impressive doors of the New York Public Library .  Her <head>interest</head> has been aroused by some new paintings which she has seen in a SoHo gallery , which a friend has compared unfavourably with the work of Lee Krasner . This comparison has fazed  her ,  as she only knows about Lee Krasner as the widow of Jackson Pollock ;  so the library visit is intended to check out reproductions of Lee Krasner 's  work ,  to see if she has to concede that her friend may be right .  The resources available to her are excellent ;  the library has an extensive stock of books ,  long runs of periodicals ,  press cuttings ,  and up - to - date facilities to find relevant material .

For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay ,  but it was Barr 's  intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair .  In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent <head>interest</head> which human beings have in the fantastic , the irrational , the spontaneous , the marvellous , the enigmatic , and the dreamlike . These qualities have always been present in the metaphors and similes of poetry but they have been less frequent in painting ,  which in the past was largely concerned with reproducing external reality ,  with decoration ,  or ,  as in the more advanced movements of recent years ,  with the composition of  color  and line into formal design .  On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .

Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant of artists , but the famous phrase indicated an <head>interest</head> in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition . Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .  Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn 's  pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .

In a number of places Pilinski completely misunderstood the indications of the original .  THE SURVEY WITH A THEME Themes in art have a fascination , since they add a subject <head>interest</head> to a viewer 's enjoyment of artistic qualities . The portrait is an endlessly interesting example ,  a theme redolent with social connotations and artistic references .  In Dostoevsky 's  opinion ,  The portrait painter seeks the moment when the model looks most like himself ;  in the capacity to find and hold this moment lies also the talent of the portraitist .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much <head>interest</head> attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Born in Hamburg ,  he was transferred to the Manor House at Amnersfield ,  the son of a remote German - American mother and of a sour ,  withdrawn ,  irritable Anglo - Scottish father ,  who would retreat behind the Times  and spend the evening in lonely state ,  smoking his pipe in his kilt .  He was never to say hello to you ,  and he once said that he would not be interested in his child until he can go out shooting with me .  ( Elsewhere , another angry gentleman of the period , Evelyn Waugh , had waited for his children to be of an age to converse with him , before taking an <head>interest</head> . ) The household shot ,  and it rode ,  to hounds and in all directions ,  but Ronald Fraser had no love for horses .

Reading plays is an essential part of your career preparation  the more plays you read the more you will understand of the  theatre 's  development .  Academic study of drama as such is not necessarily useful for the actor ,  but an awareness of playwrights and their various styles is  of practical value .  A play is primary a piece of action and although a script contains some scenic and character description , the essential <head>interest</head> lies in the dialogue and the action arising from it . A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .  It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .

You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer .  If you have had problems finding an agent ,  you might consider the possibility of applying to join a co - operative where actors work together and run their own agency .  These can offer real support to new actors seeking their first taste of work and such co - ops do show enormous <head>interest</head> in the work of drama students in their last term . It 's  difficult to evaluate how successful such co - ops are but many do seem to gain work on a fairly reasonable basis for their members ,  and they are certainly worth considering .

Also ,  there can be no doubt that the South would intervene in the North on behalf of the catholic  nationalist minority if Britain withdrew and civil war broke out .  Equally ,  Southern catholic nationalists prefer a unified Irish state ,  though a majority of 54 per cent would accept a federal one based on the present two state units .  One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic nationalist population as a whole , though one in which certain groups , namely farming <head>interests</head> and the church , at both clerical and popular levels , have strategically dominated , at least until recently . By 1914 ,  the protestant  loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary .  Issues of class conflict within the group were to remain largely subordinate ,  as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day .

Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests ,  particularly as represented by the conservative party .  But that is what the arrangement was : an alliance rather than a consolidated <head>interest</head> or a genuinely shared culture . Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation .  The British government only obtained certain concessions from the Stormont government in implementing measures of the welfare state variety after 1944 .

In 1927 ,  1929 ,  1956 ,  and 1960 ,  there were plenary synods and councils .  Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .  In the North , the bishops pursued the Irish catholic community 's <head>interests</head> in what could only be called a spirit of pillarization . This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media ,  schools ,  cultural organizations ,  welfare services ,  and hospitals are duplicated ,  and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities .  In Holland there is even a third or state sector .

There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,  particularly in the shipyards ,  and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has noted ,  the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material <head>interests</head> of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs ,  and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances ,  religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions ,  become embroiled in cementing alliances ,  and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

It proved to be a period of strained relations with the English liberals ,  who were allies of the Irish party ,  but who were also in favour of bringing schooling more and more under state rather than church control  ( Miller 1973 :  817 ,  12038 ,  26892 )  .  By this time ,  the schools frequented by Roman catholics in Ireland were also largely under the direct control of the church 's  clerics .  But secularizing moves by the English liberals over the Education Bills of 1902 , 1906 , and a private member 's Bill of 1911 led the Irish hierarchy to question some of the political intentions of the Irish politicians , who it was feared might sell out the church 's <head>interest</head> in schools . According to the Liberal - Irish alliance ,  the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill ,  aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control :  that is ,  giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .  With the Irish party abstaining ,  both English and Irish Roman catholic bishops began to pressurize the leader of the Irish party ,  Redmond ,  and his associates to support the Conservative bill .

In addition ,  Roman catholic schools in Ireland ,  in continuity with the belief and practice of Roman catholics in a number of other countries ,  have a different concept and practice of teaching religion in the schools from that of the majority of protestant traditions .  This ranges from the presence of religious symbols in the classrooms and corridors of the schools to religious services such as mass or the saying of the rosary ,  and finally to the specific form of religious education which is praxis oriented .  Learning , singing , and praying are rolled up into one : catechesis , as opposed to dialogue or concerned <head>interest</head> for religious matters .

At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .  Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls , chimney breasts , stairs and other internal features of <head>interest</head> , which is highly destructive of the building 's historic character . The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .  In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .

We contest that there are no laws written in stone ,  and that there is room for hybrids .  As regards restoration ,  just as we would not dream of stripping out the original interior of the Blackfriar ,  by the same token we would not seek to preserve a Thirties estate pub which had long since ceased to address the needs of the community it was built to serve .  It is in our <head>interests</head> as designers in this field to ensure that the pub tradition that we all hold so dear remains a living tradition . As was so chillingly illustrated by the postwar period of mass destruction and misconceived redevelopment ,  it is possible to throw the baby out with the bathwater .  However ,  to entrap our pub tradition within a rigid set of rules and guidelines is at best to condemn it to becoming an anachronism ,  if not to extinguish it altogether .

Immediately the police officer/anthropologist sets out to undertake research or record fieldnotes he is forced to confront a moral dilemma .  This exists simply because he must necessarily reveal aspects of a closed and somewhat secretive society to the outside if he is to pursue any ethnography at all .

He becomes crucially aware that they have little need of any critical analysis ,  for as Benyon  ( ibid .  23 )  goes on to point out ,  historically ,  the powerful have encouraged hagiography ,  not critical investigation .

It had a marked effect on those who read his poetry ,  and a few  years  later Leonard was to find himself tutored by one of Pound 's  most sympathetic admirers and directed to the understanding of the American 's  verse ,  somewhat to Leonard 's  concern ,  as we shall see .  We should not ,  however ,  think that these years were those of some frustrated novice - monk  ( not that Judaism has such in any case !  )  of solitary and sober reading from dawn till nightfall .  Leonard was full - blooded , physically and temperamentally , and these teenage years saw him active in a wide range of sporting <head>interests</head> : cycling ( one of his favourite pastimes then ) , skiing , swimming , canoeing , sailing and ice - hockey ( in which he made the school team ) , boxing and wrestling , though he was very little involved in the last two .

One year older than Leonard ,  he went through the varying experiences of adolescence with him ,  sharing not least Leonard 's  musical interest  ( Morton played both the banjo and the trombone )  ,  as well as a variety of pastimes and a healthy interest in the fairer sex .  Unlike Leonard , he had very little <head>interest</head> in the synagogue and broke from its traditions much more decisively , finding Leonard 's continuance somewhat irritating . ( Krantz is modelled on Rosengarten in The Favourite Game  ,  though highly fictionalised .  )  He was always impressed with Leonard 's  room ,  which he found to resemble more a study than a youth 's  bedroom  already the style was evident .

Nevertheless ,  he felt bound to accept the challenge of post - graduate work at Columbia University in New York ,  albeit with deepening reservations .  Moreover ,  Dudek had taken his doctorate at Columbia ,  and Federico Garia Lorca had studied there a few years before Leonard was born .  Almost immediately on arrival , surrounded by the cosmopolitan excitement of New York , its immense anonymity , the total lack of personal <head>interest</head> shown towards him after having been the centre of warmth and appreciation in Montreal , he knew that it was not for him. Columbia University 's  Law School had no charms ,  no personal comfort  ( like the surrounding high - rise buildings )  ;  there must be another way .  Paul Robeson  himself a belatedly famed son of the Law School  might embody law and song ,  and F.R. Scott might embody law and poetry ,  but even he recognised the more profound call of the muse :  poetry first ,  he had said and the poetic element all the way through ,  which in the hurly - burly of the clothing industry ,  was even less possible .

MacCabe and Heath had studied in Paris ,  and Signs of the Times  has its niche in postwar cultural history ,  marking the first major re - entry of French intellectual influences since Eliot 's  adherence to Remy de Gourmont and the French neoclassicists ,  half a century earlier .  For the sake of convenience I shall apply the term la nouvelle critique  to the complex  of ideas emerging from the Paris of the 1960s ,  including many diverse strands :  the classical structuralism of the early Barthes ,  the poststructuralism of his later work ,  the deconstructionism of Derrida ,  and whatever name one gives to the work of Foucault and Lacan ,  in taxonomic historiography and dissident psychoanalysis respectively .  Frank Kermode was the first senior academic in English studies to take a sympathetic <head>interest</head> in la nouvelle critique , particularly its analysis of narrative . For some years before his move to Cambridge he chaired a seminar at University College London ,  which discussed the literary implications of structuralism ,  semiotics ,  and emergent poststructuralism .  He has remarked ,  No other phase of my academic life has given me so much pleasure and instruction .

In its new freedom ,  it can be seen to cause a new reality to come into being   ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Or consider the density of trope and implication in the following :  New New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's  essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds ,  aiming ,  in its no - holds - barred  encounter with the text ,  for a coherence  and validity  of response ,  not objectivity and truth  ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Raymond Tallis has described this passage as being of great <head>interest</head> to the pathologist of modern literary theory . In certain respects ,  what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version .  Both were directed towards the formalist reading of literary texts ,  and some anglophone academics tried to minimize the strangeness of French imports by saying that la nouvelle critique  was only offering a new version of what had long been familiar in the Anglo - American academy .

The enthusiasm has ,  of course ,  been exploited ,  in the opportunistic launching of courses in women 's  studies ,  and by the publishing industry which has filled the shelves of bookshops  general as well as academic  with books with women in their titles .  One of the most interesting and welcome results of literary feminism has been the reprinting of forgotten texts ,  usually by women but occasionally by men .  In an earlier Chapter I argued that the canon is bursting , because of the advent of other anglophone literatures , and the increasing <head>interest</head> in contemporary writing . Undoubtedly ,  the new availability of earlier texts of feminist interest is helping the explosion .  At the same time ,  at the level of practical pedagogy ,  there is a counter - tendency in the study of the national canon to concentrate more and more on a small and diminishing number of texts .

It is noticeable that though Derrida is a philosopher ,  albeit one interested in literature ,  and has always worked in an academic - philosophical context ,  even if on the margins of the subject ,  his major impact in North America has been in literature departments .  Though some of his followers have philosophical training and interests ,  and are acquainted with the matrices of Derrida 's  thought in Hegel ,  Husserl ,  and Heidegger ,  his transmission in literary and cultural contexts has meant that his ideas have become simplified ,  his paradoxes and contradictions tamed and diminished .  One writer , whose <head>interest</head> in poststructuralism is primarily philosophical , has commented : the reception of Derrida 's  work ,  perhaps more than that of any other recent French thinker ,  has been marked by an astonishingly casual and unquestioning acceptance of certain extremely condensed  not to say sloganistic  characterisations of the history of Western thought ,  as if this history could be dismissed through its reduction to a set of perfunctory dualisms .  People in literature departments are not used to handling ideas ,  it not being their mtier  ,  and traditionally they were not  required to ,  beyond such elementary tokens as the Elizabethian World Picture or the Death of God .

Thus ,  The Tempest  is about colonialism ;  not only The taming of the Shrew  but King Lear  and Measure for Measure  are a focus for feminist readings ;  while Henry V  encodes a contemporary Elizabethan colonialist endeavour ,  the fantasy of a successful Irish campaign .  These readings are intermittently illuminating ,  if reductive ,  and basically they are doing what criticism has always done ,  which is to interpret the works of the past in the terms and concepts of the critic 's  own age .  It is precisely this capacity for renewed interpretation that makes literature of more than simply historical <head>interest</head> . Latterday Marxist interpreters of Shakespeare are doing much the same as the conservative proponents of the Elizabethan World Picture did thirty or forty years ago ,  though with a different  conceptual model .  The contemporary New Historicists ,  however ,  are unlike interpreters of the past ,  in that they are concerned with exclusively political readings ,  without any possibility of aesthetic or affective responses .

If this meant there were potential conflicts between research and pedagogy ,  that was a price that had to be paid .  With the passing of time ,  the subject expanded further ,  institutional pressures became greater ,  and a gap widened between the professionals who taught literature and the poets ,  novelists ,  and dramatists ,  somewhere out in society ,  who wrote it ,  notwithstanding the increasing presence of contemporary literature as a university subject .  In this last respect , American experience is significantly different ; writers - in - residence are common on campuses as teachers of creative writing , though literary theorists show little <head>interest</head> in what is being written . Donald Davie has suggested that one reason for the explosion of theory is that it provides a stamping ground for the innumerable people in departments of English  ( also of French ,  of German ,  of Classics )  who have energy and intelligence but no literary sensibility .  Davie 's  provocative point is well taken .

This current feeling for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shifting the emphasis from popular modern writing to earlier literature .  Chaucer looked at in isolation can seem daunting ,  but Chaucer read in a cultural and historical context ,  with visual and other aids ,  could come alive as a great poet ,  speaking across six centuries ,  in a Gadamerian fusion of horizons .  I am not , though , recommending the ideological antiquarianism of the New Historicism , which has little <head>interest</head> in poetry as such . This is a speculative proposal ,  merely ,  and it may fall foul of the fact  that in our image - ridden culture reading is difficult ,  and literary texts still demand to be read  ,  rigorously and carefully .  In cultural history reading about something may be good enough ;  in studying literature it is not.

BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor ,  Lord Mackay of Clashfern ,  to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors ,  Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma ,  the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's  Green Papers and to abandon the hustings .  Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's Bill were total freedom of choice for the client , unless the <head>interests</head> of justice otherwise require . When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .  In the first category we have criminal cases ,  judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .

In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .  In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category , general civil cases , parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the <head>interests</head> of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied ,  however ,  that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy .  While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .

The most substantial ,  Honour Hong Kong ,  is sponsored by many of the colony 's  biggest companies .

Hong Kong companies are not well - known moralists : their main <head>interest</head> lies in staunching their own losses of trained workers , and preserving the machinery of government . To answer that immediate need ,  the British government has been agonising over how to offer a single tranche of passports ,  perhaps 100,000 ,  to Hong Kong ,  in such a way as to target recipients whom it believes play vital roles in the public and private sector .

Britain has been muttering that if it perceives a consensus for democracy in Hong Kong ,  it will start talking tough to Peking at a diplomatic level ,  and perhaps even adopt the Legislative Council proposals for 1995 in the teeth of Chinese opposition and without regard to convergence with the Basic Law .  If so ,  it will come to the negotiating table severely handicapped by its past history of deference :  it could as easily have confronted the issue four years ago ,  when it would have stood more of a chance of winning .  It would also now risk being seen to act as much in the <head>interests</head> of its own credibility , as in support of a sincerely - held belief . Another post - Tiananmen worry ,  greater for for Hong Kong than for any other interested party ,  must be the future of China 's  economy and economic policies .

Lonrho boss intervenes in Ward case By STEPHEN WARD TINY ROWLAND , chairman of the Lonrho group , which has extensive <head>interests</head> in Kenya , yesterday said he had discussed the Julie Ward case with the country 's president , Daniel arap Moi . He was replying to the disclosure by John Ward ,  the dead woman 's  father ,  that he had written to Mr Rowland earlier this year asking for assistance in persuading the Kenyan authorities to open a murder inquiry .  Throughout the long inquest ,  which resumes on Thursday ,  Mr Ward 's  counsel has suggested there was a sustained cover - up after her disappearance and the discovery of her severed and charred remains in the Masai Mara game reserve .

If Nice Work was the novel with which Lodge gave two of his keenest preoccupations the slip  the university ,  partially ,  and Catholicism ,  totally  it was also the book which should end the habitual conflation in some minds of his own career and output with that of Malcolm Bradbury .

Typically , the Birmingham man 's <head>interest</head> in writing for television coincided with the East Anglia one 's . Lodge was recently amused by the arrival from America of the first critical monograph about him.

The stock market theory is that the Goldsmith contingent needs a new challenge now its bid for BAT Industries has effectively evaporated .

Caroline Willbourne ,  a London barrister specialising in family law ,  said decriminalisation of sexual offences within the family where the offender admitted the abuse was in the interests of child victims .

You often find the civil court has dealt with the abuse and the perpetrator in the context of what is in the best <head>interests</head> of the child . But she added that prosecution and imprisonment by a criminal court did not serve the interests of the family as a whole ,  or of the child who remained part of it ,  or how victims would deal with contact with the abuser after release .  Ms Willbourne also called for the civil courts to be given new powers to exclude an abuser from the home instead of the child .

Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions .  Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's  punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin .

So long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave  a right which the present Government sought ,  at one stage ,  to abolish  this handicap is acceptable ,  even though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigant .  A less acceptable handicap is the special rule that the application for judicial review must normally be made within only three months from the decision complained of .  It is in the public <head>interest</head> for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptly , so that the administration and citizens alike know what the law is . But it is unjust that the individual 's  right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the application .  As the Law Commission recommended in 1976 ,  the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administration .

STRONG words and a tendency to make unambiguous rulings have epitomised Sir Anthony Barrowclough 's  five - year tenure in the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration .

Firm <head>judgments</head> of the cases he has investigated have often been accompanied by hard - hitting comments about the problems his office has encountered . This is very much a product of his legal background which ,  in a career spanning 40 years as a lawyer ,  has seen him spurn a more lucrative profession to concentrate on the injusticesthat accompany bureaucracies like the Civil Service .  Born in 1924 ,  his ambitions were delayed by the outbreak of the second world war in which he served in the Royal Naval Reserve from 1943 ,  first in Coastal Forces and then on minesweepers ,  rising to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised three years later .

Factors which undoubtedly influence <head>judgments</head> of seriousness , such as the existence of provocation , or the difference between premeditated and impulsive violence , are accorded no legal significance and are left to the sentencing stage . The main exception to this concerns the status of the victim ,  with separate offences for assaults on police - officers and wilful neglect of children ,  for example .  How might the non - fatal offences be reformed so as to conform with the principle of fair labelling ?

With this in mind ,  he is painting a picture of the disaster that would follow if either of the two main parties formed a minority government without a firm agreement with the Liberal Democrats .  The price of such an agreement ,  of course ,  would be electoral reform  which ,  purely incidentally ,  would give his party the balance of power after any election in the foreseeable future .  The outlook for both the economy and for government finances , in Mr Ashdown 's <head>judgment</head> , is dire in fact , it is likely to prove immeasurably worse than either Conservatives or Labour have realised . Although he would not care to make predictions ,  it is not unlikely that the other side of the election ,  particularly in the case of Labour ,  we will have to take some very ,  very tough action indeed  not the least of which will include raising interest rates .  True ,  there are no signs that either Mr Major or Mr Kinnock would contemplate a coalition .

An occasional exploit deservedly catches the newspaper headlines ,  like the case of a picture spotted by a London dealer ,  David Carritt .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops '  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .  That the bishops were affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stood to <head>lose</head> money and independence if such a scheme were implemented seems likely . Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .  The hierarchy feared the move as the thin end of the wedge of secularism and the totalitarian state .

Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland ,  the catholic schools '  sector is provided for out of state funds ,  and remains under the governorship of the local clergy ,  now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards .  Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's determination not to <head>lose</head> control of them . The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .  With the exception of a small group of public schools ,  there is the apparently simple distinction between state schools and Roman catholic schools which occurs in Britain .

It is important for these pilots to develop the habit of checking the position of the gliding site immediately after releasing the tow and to re - check it regularly every few circles .  It is also important to be aware of the wind direction and the amount of drift ,  and to avoid drifting down wind whenever possible .  Beginners often continue to struggle with weak lift without realising that they are , in fact , <head>losing</head> height and drifting further away . If the variometer is fluctuating and reading up on one side of the circle and down a little on the other ,  the probability is that the glider is not climbing at all but is just drifting further down wind .  If the glider is down wind of the site ,  the decision to return must be taken before the glider gets to less than an angle of about 20 to the field in light winds ,  and 3040 in windy weather .

The following remarks apply particularly to the roundhouse kick and the side kick and only to a lesser extent to the front kick .  I have repeatedly stressed the importance of keeping your centre - line turned towards the opponent ,  yet some kicks require that you turn it away ,  sometimes by as much as 120 !  This must of necessity put you in a very weak defensive position and I would maintain that this is responsible for <head>losing</head> more bouts than any other factor . The kick misses ,  recovery is slow and the alert opponent has scored before you know what 's  happened .  It therefore makes sense to use kicks judiciously only when there is a clear opening and the opponent is not expecting a kick .

You must not prescribe aims and preferences for art .  Why prescribe anything for it ?  It will never get lost or <head>lose</head> its way . It was always true to reality and always walked in line with man 's  progress and development .  The ideal of beauty and normality cannot perish in a healthy society ;  and for this reason you ought to let art go its own way ad be confident that it will not go astray

They cost around 50 a piece ,  less than a tenth the cost of the gas lasers .  Wieman told EW  + WW  that the great benefit if this simplification is that it will enable a greater number of laboratories to participate in low temperature research and discover more and more bizarre properties of matter .

When asked what temperature at which this transformation would occur ,  Wieman commented :  It depends on the density and the number of atoms in your trap ,  the more atoms you 've got ,  the higher the temperature .  We 're at one millionth of a degree above absolute zero .

It is never very apparent what Freudian claims are based on ,  though they are widely accepted in our culture .  My scepticism has been reinforced by the recent work of Frederick Crews ,  who for many years was a leading psychoanalytic critic in America .  During the 1970s he began to <head>lose</head> faith in the whole Freudian programme , and in his recent book , Skeptical Engagements , he provides detailed and substantially supported arguments for abandoning it . Freud is not ,  however ,  likely to be generally rejected ,  since he is so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the West .  Furthermore ,  attacks such as Crews 's  are ,  as he acknowledges ,  not taken seriously and replied to in their own terms ,  but treated as symptoms of repressed disturbance .

Around the world today ,  more than 100 countries still retain the death penalty ,  and two out of every three human beings live under governments that use torture and other cruel ,  inhuman and degrading treatment against them .

In practical terms this <head>means</head> that although letter - writing to governments regarding prisoners continues to be the cornerstone of the campaign work other methods have been introduced to enhance the effectiveness of the hundreds of thousands of letters that Amnesty members write each year .

Colvin had known Burne - Jones ,  and was persuaded to write a preface for a London gallery show .

If any one element in his style is to be singled out as predominant ,  it is that haunting expression of far - away desire never absent from the eyes and lips ,  and conveyed in every gesture ,  feature and attitude .  Giacometti was an artist with very different artistic aims ,  clearly expounded by Valerie J. Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ,  Washington ,  in 1988 .

We have liked him for being into free speech and free love ,  and for what he  has to say about convergences of the two ,  and about the curbs which revolution and its regimes has placed on them .

New actors need to try and widen their range all the time and in the same breath find a way of being  commercially as well as artistically viable .  I have been very lucky ;  the right opportunities have come along and yet every time you take them you are looking forward immediately to the next challenge .  I <head>mean</head> the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part after that initial excitement it 's a bit downhill not because the work is n't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak . I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual performance .  In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .

The Key Mythical Structures of Protestant  Loyalist Popular Religion It could be argued that the myths of Ulster protestantism and the institution of the Orange order take the place of the more centralized clerical organization of Roman catholicism in providing some element of overall religious unity among protestant loyalists .  By myth is <head>meant</head> here what has generally come to be accepted within sociology and social anthropology since the work of Levi - Strauss : an account of the origins of a society or of particular crucial events in its life , which unite the cosmos to the social structure by actively shaping everyday life perceptions . The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a  faith consciousness .  The salvation history of the Bible is coupled with what is seen as a significant period in the history of the protestants of Ireland .

The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .  It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate , they <head>meant</head> they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state . But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .

What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When ,  as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh ,  there is a whole series of pictures to choose from ,  books can be written on the self - images of one artist alone .  This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's writing , since it tempts the rash into speculation , while an impoverished eye will <head>miss</head> relevant and useful comparisons . A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .

What you are saying is that everyone seems to <head>miss</head> the work of Litz Pisk a legendary movement teacher at Central School who had such movement sense . A S. I remember when I was working as a dogsbody in the 59 Theatre Company in Manchester a group of Central School students came to be the spirits in a production of The Tempest  and these were Pisk trained and had ,  it seemed to me then ,  a marvellous range of body language .  You do see this much more in foreign companies and I think if we in Britain could match the physical and the vocal more we would really be on top with our training resources .

Actually ,  this seldom happens and one technique usually lands before the other. Nevertheless ,  many referees take the easy option and give a simultaneous score decision .  This is all the more annoying when one person 's attack was n't valid anyway because it <head>missed</head> the scoring area , or was otherwise unacceptable . Some referees appear to see only one half of a pair of techniques and ,  while reverse punches are seldom missed ,  snap punches to the face often are .  In such cases ,  the reverse punch may be given simply because the referee failed to recognise the snap punch .

But that <head>misses</head> the point , if theory can be identified with literature .

Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .

Andrew Harrison <head>missed</head> a straightforward chance from 25 metres . He missed with two other attempts ,  one from longer range and a sitter from 20 metres ,  failing to reward the efforts of his pack ,  who were considerably outweighed by the Lancashire eight .  Cumbria threatened to fall apart when they lost their hooker ,  Derek Dougan ,  just before the interval ,  as Lancashire 's  Mark Hesketh finished off a surge by Shaun Gallagher ,  initiated by the lively Dewi Morris ,  to give Lancashire a 9 - 0 lead at the break.

From its domination by the old ascendancy ,  the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches .  In fact ,  in rural areas today ,  the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism  ( Harris 1972 :  1625 )  .  It is important to <head>note</head> that these organizations are internally stratified . Those nearer the top ,  particularly in the Black Preceptory ,  the inner sanctum of the society structure ,  are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community :  wealthy farmers ,  businessmen ,  good churchmen ,  or at least of known moral probity .  They tend to represent the religious as opposed to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .

The civil war was not fought over the partition of the island as is popularly believed .

In parallel with the Republic ,  class politics has flourished even less on the protestant  loyalist side ,  despite the periodic strength of protestant trade unionism  ( Patterson 1980 )  .  There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,  particularly in the shipyards ,  and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has <head>noted</head> , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .  By providing core beliefs ,  and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances ,  religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions ,  become embroiled in cementing alliances ,  and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

Religious education in these schools is officially non - denominational or biblically based and loyalist sentiments are promoted .  But religious education has been known to be fundamentalist and in some cases anti - catholic ,  depending on the teacher .  It is important to <head>note</head> that , since the system began in the late 1920s , there has never been a significant move to split up the schools for use by the separate denominations , something which would have been feasible in the larger towns . The Northern public - sector schools come from the partly voluntary system of pre - Partition .  In 1928 ,  these schools entered the system of maintained schools ,  whereby ,  in exchange for full payment of current costs and 65 per cent of capital expenditure ,  the former owners and managers ,  usually churches ,  were allowed two - thirds representation  on the local board of management ,  with the other third coming from the local authority .

This prescriptive approach has been repeated as recently as October 1988 ,  when the director of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools in Northern Ireland said that people who sent their children to integrated schools rather than catholic ones were breaking the law of the church .  There is also strong central support from Rome which places catholic education at the centre of its cultural catholicism ideal .  It should be <head>noted</head> that the largest threat to totalizing control of schools in Ireland has so far come from the integrated schooling movement . This movement has a double constituency ,  one in the Northern ,  the other in the Southern ,  state .  Their membership ,  mainly middle - class ,  have met considerable difficulty in trying to achieve their limited goals  integrated schooling for the children of those parents who wish it  though some of the membership in the early days were aiming at a total integration of the schooling system .

It is an often - repeated truism to say that the institution of the pub is unique to Britain  but it is still one which is well worth resurrecting .  It is also a fairly obvious statement to say that historic pubs have served the function well for hundreds of years .  As Alan Crawford <head>noted</head> in the SAVE/CAMRA report Time Gentlemen Please of 1983 , old pubs are not isolated or monumental , but part of the fabric of the city , and of people 's ordinary lives , street - corner history . They are not arcane but easily enjoyable .  They are not inaccessible but quite the reverse ,  and they have their original working use still .

In October of that year the AR   regretted that nearly all competition entries had evaded the key problem and had signally failed to achieve the genuine pub atmosphere .  Contemporary design ,  the magazine 's  editor regretted ,  because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not appear immediately familiar ,  whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent  no matter how misguided in themselves  have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere .  As pub designer Tim May <head>noted</head> in his address to CAMRA 's AGM of 1990 : By any objective standards , the competition was a disaster . The response of the 1960s and 70s to this failure to capture the essence of the traditional pub was the ruthlessly - applied corporate image and the proliferation of fun theme - pubs .  Thankfully ,  most of the more extreme excesses of the theme pub craze  so ably analysed by Christopher Hutt in his classic work of 1973  have now disappeared .

Disregard for the individual qualities of pub interiors can be fatal .  A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson <head>noted</head> in 1980 , An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade , it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built . The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times  the vaults ,  snugs ,  parlours ,  each with their own character ,  can still provide a pleasant ,  varied atmosphere .  However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .

Architecturally ,  the inn was often distinguished by an inner courtyard ,  sometimes with gallery ,  reached through an archway in the facade .  Some examples from the pre - reformation period ,  such as the magnificent George Inn at Norton St. Philip ,  Somerset ,  originally constructed in the 14th century ,  were established by monasteries for pilgrims and travellers ;  but after the dissolutions of the 1530s all were held in secular hands and subsequently catered for the increasing number of road travellers in the 16th century and the stage coach trade that first appeared in the early 17th century .  William Harrison <head>noted</head> in 1587 that : In all our inns we have plenty of ale ,  beer and sundry kinds of wine and such is the capacity of some of these that they are able to lodge two hundred or three hundred persons and their horses .  In the medieval period the church was also involved in the brewing of its own church - ales ,  which were made on an occasional basis and produced a useful income supplement ;  in late medieval times these were often served in the Church House that frequently adjoined the churchyard .

Countless other pubs which date from the Georgian period ,  or at least incorporate a significant element of Georgian building work ,  have suffered similar fates .  National brewing giants such as Allied or Whitbread ,  though ,  are not the only villains ;  small independent firms can be just as insensitive in their treatment of their tied houses .  Claire Hunt , for instance , <head>noted</head> in 1988 of North Western brewers Robinsons that they appear on the whole to be fairly oblivious to the individual merits of their historic pubs . One key problem with the more domestically - scaled Georgian pubs is that they were often originally conceived as ,  or converted from ,  modest homes .  The numerous internal partitions that result have often proved anathema to modern - day breweries .

The computer system will only bring the returns that the company expects if the people using it are using the system fully ,  which can be guaranteed through investment in adequate training .  It must also be <head>noted</head> that the computer systems generate information and it is how this information is used that influences the returns on the total package . The onus is on the company to ensure that staff are making intelligent decisions on the information that the computer system provides and this comes from in - house training .  Telephone Management Systems customer care director Anne Nunn also speaks for many suppliers when she talks about the imbalance between the knowledge required of hotel staff and the time devoted to training them .

In giving evidence ,  Michael Bichard ,  Chief Executive of the SSAB ,  listed the 14 offices  ( out of around 470 )  that failed to reach tolerable standards .

One of the most successful ways of giving a different quality to the steps and poses of classical dance and of transforming them into demi - caractre  style is to relate them intimately to appropriate music .  Every country has its own way of performing the traditional dances which go hand in hand with certain musical characteristics .  Choreographers should <head>note</head> the particular relationships between steps and notes , enchanements and phrases and how strong or weak beats affect the rhythm . They cannot be too strict about this relationship ,  for the score ,  whether commissioned or arranged ,  will only give some flavour of the traditional ways of singing and dancing .  This can be easily recognised if Bizet 's  music for Carmen  is compared with De Falla 's  fur The Three - Cornered Hat  .

The whole performance is based on the classical vocabulary of steps shorn of every convention so that he can go swifter than an arrow from an archer 's  bow .  Every leap ,  turn ,  beat and somersault is perfectly co - ordinated with the phrase and with the music despite the fact that the dance scarcely reflects the period when the music was composed as does Ashton 's  choreography in other ballets  ( see page 42 )  .  Choreographers should therefore <head>note</head> that it is possible to design movements which may contradict the music that is being played , but not if they contradict the mood and rhythmic qualities of the whole context . Mendelssohn 's  music is light - hearted .  It does not probe the deeper emotions .

A further consideration about feminist criticism ,  is that it is more practical than theoretical ,  in a familiar English way ,  and that unlike other schools in the rainbow coalition ,  it is actively concerned in producing readings of particular texts .  Most of them are produced by women ,  who provide insights that come from relating female experience to a body of writing ;  logically ,  there is no reason why these insights should not be available to male critics with the right sympathies and sensibility ,  but in practice most of this criticism is by women .  Such criticism , it is worth <head>noting</head> , is basically mimetic ; literature is assumed to relate to experience . Feminist criticism ,  like Marxist ,  is avowedly evaluative ,  which sharply distinguishes it from the generality of current academic criticism ,  of whatever school .  This is desirable in itself ,  though I do not warm to the feminist MacCarthyism which subjects texts to a close ,  hostile interrogation in a search for sexist attitudes .

The slowdown in military spending and escalating costs of armament programmes will make it increasingly difficult for any company ,  even one the size of BAe ,  to go it alone .

l IAN McCULLOCH Candleland  ( WEA UK :  WX303C )  Ian McCulloch was the most memorable thing about Echo And The Bunnymen ,  the Liverpool acid revivalists of the early Eighties  ( acid as in Syd Barrett ,  psychedelia and funny oily slides put over the spotlights ,  rather than mega - profitable discos in aircraft hangars and gate - crashing visits from the uniformed branch )  .  He was the one with the distant ,  distracted look and the voice which sounded as though it were the product of an experiment by Dr Timothy Leary .  All of these things can be found here , in an album which could well be a Bunnymen work , were it not for the absence of much of the pomposity to which they were inclined ( though , unrepentant fans will <head>note</head> , not all of it judging by track titles like The White Hotel and Proud to Fall ) . It is a consistent piece ,  full of melodies that quickly start to nag ,  expensive arrangements and above it all McCulloch 's  ingenuous ,  whispering ,  conspiratorial voice .  Horse 's  Head  ( a Godfather of a track )  ,  The Flickering Wall and the title track should provide acid fans with as big a fix as they will need until the next Wonder Stuff album .

Now suffering ,  in the proper sense ,  is caused precisely by external factors affecting us ,  physical conditions or the actions of other human beings which afflict or constrain us .  It is because God is not subject to such things that He may be said not to suffer ,  at least in the way human beings do .  Belief in the impassibility of God , it is worth <head>noting</head> , was developed in the early Christian centuries against the background of popular religious belief in the world of that day , where gods were no more than human beings on a large scale , subject to the same contingencies , passions , frustrations and feelings of pain or pleasure that determine human nature .

John Alderson made a case for the reintroduction of community policing in 1982  ( Alderson 1982 ,  also see 1979 )  ,  but its advantages were recognized much earlier when the House of Commons Select Committee on Race Relations examined relations between the police and ethnic minorities in 1972 ,  and in 1976 a report from the National Police College placed a central emphasis upon it  ( Pope 1976 )  .  But , as Weatheritt <head>noted</head> , amid all this , there is considerable confusion over what analysts mean by the concept community policing ( Weatheritt 1983 ; also see Hartmann et al . 1988 ;  Trojamowicz and Moore 1988 )  .  It has been loosely referred to as any mode of policing other than the rapid - response crime control type ;  an alternative which specifically seeks to make constables part of the community by making them responsible for a geographical area ,  known as permanent or home beats ;  a means of developing communication between the police and the local community ;  and a process by which responsibility for crime control and prevention is shared with the community ,  both also known as community relations  ( Weatheritt 1983 :  45 )  .

Its slightly more liberal ethos seemed to affect Krupskaia ,  for when she first went to work in the People 's  Commissariat of Education  (  Narkompros  )  after the revolution ,  she stressed the need for independence from central management by intellectuals .  Yet by 1920 she was already submitting to governmental pressures in her Moscow office .

For lack of sympathetic agents ,  the peasants were often left to their own devices in matters of general and even political culture .

By 1987 there were clearly long - term problems emerging for the balance of payments .  But ,  in his distinctly supply - side programme of aiding the wealthy and achievers in general with tax cuts ,  his relative disregard for social inequality and the mounting costs for the unemployed and other socially disadvantaged groups ,  and his hedonistic endorsement of private gain ,  Lawson 's  financial methods became the pivot of government policy .  Social commentators <head>noted</head> , in a transatlantic usage , the rise of the yuppy ( young upwardly - mobile professional ) whose girl - friends and families took over older working - class areas such as Limehouse , Islington , or Hackney .

The Attlee government in some ways is a final commentary on the deep - rooted strength of this faith in the institutions of the state .  The partial reaction against it in the Tory 1950s  setting the people free  did not lead to the contraction of the government service .  On the contrary , as Professor Northcote Parkinson <head>noted</head> at the time , the civil service expanded as never before , locally as well as nationally , and the prominent place of central - government expenditure ( consistently over 40 per cent as a proportion of gross national product in this period ) is an outstanding feature of the period 195164 . By the time of the Wilson government in 1964 ,  it was clear that the old confidence in governmental planning was ,  for a variety of reasons ,  in some disarray .  In part ,  it was part of a wider decline in the authority of national institutions from the monarchy to the police ;  satire and culture criticism reflected the process and took it further .

The great gains in public health ,  following the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948 ,  was modified by ,  among other factors ,  the existence of class attitudes towards health which meant ,  for instance ,  that older working - class communities in the industrial north were still marred by the health problems of a poor diet ,  excessive beer drinking and smoking ,  and a prevalence of heart and lung disease in consequence .  The passion for health foods and mineral water ,  and exercises such as jogging and aerobics ,  were largely middle - class enthusiasms .  The Second World War , apparently a halcyon era for popular unity and pulling through together was , as <head>noted</head> , a time of social division , which wartime experiences such as evacuation or the pattern of female employment intensified . This continued to plague Britain as a society after 1945 .  In the 1980s ,  under the Thatcher regime ,  most of the indices of social equality seemed to show that things were not improving .

The failure to reverse the spending growth was a disappointing outcome for the advocates of cuts in the many bruising Cabinet battles over public spending between 1979 and 1982 .  There have been marked shifts in spending between programmes since 1979 .  It is worth <head>noting</head> , however , that the spending priorities have not been radically dissimilar from those planned by the outgoing Labour government , which also planned for cuts in spending on education and housing and an expansion in spending on defence , law and order , and social security . Table 8 .  1 above shows that between 1978  9 and 1988  9 there was a major and planned increase in real terms in spending on defence and law and order ;  spending on housing and industry were heavily cut ,  while on education  ( helped by a fall in numbers of school children )  and on transport it stayed fairly constant .  For all the concern over the level of public spending the British share as a proportion of GDP in 1979 was only at the mid - point of most western states .

In economic policy ,  of course ,  this autonomy of government had been further compromised by Mr Heath 's  search for agreement with the trade unions on incomes policy between 1972 and 1974 and by succeeding Labour governments .  The task therefore was to recover greater autonomy at the centre and limit the state 's  obligations to those that were essential and/or that it could carry out .  As already <head>noted</head> , the attraction of monetarism for the new Conservative leadership by 1979 was that it promised a method of controlling inflation by means , as it were , of an automatic pilot ; there would be no need for government to compromise its authority with producer groups . Strict control of the money supply and a curb on government borrowing would squeeze inflation out of the economy .  The government would not print the money to pay for inflationary wage deals .

A scheme of school vouchers was considered and abandoned although a scheme for loans in higher education is to be introduced .  No action has been taken to trim tax relief for pension contributions or house mortgages  ( although the Treasury has ended the entitlement to tax relief for two mortgages on one property and has maintained a limit of 30,000 on mortgages entitled to tax relief )  .  In December 1985 the long - awaited Fowler review of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme ( SERPS ) produced only a reduction in the pension benefits rather than an abolition of the scheme ( it is worth <head>noting</head> , however , that the encouragement to leave SERPS for private schemes has had some success ; by mid - 1989 over one million people had left ) . On the NHS ,  for all the managerial changes and efficiency campaigns ,  Mrs Thatcher has made clear that it will remain a largely state - financed service .  Finally ,  the much - heralded Medium Term Financial Strategy  ( see p. 228 )  and monetarism were cast aside .

At a Conservative party meeting on 28 August , Amery <head>noted</head> that Horne on the whole agrees with me that we have got into a considerable mess and that the great thing is to extricate our people as soon as possible , while Hailsham in his speech supported entirely what had been done but trusted that it would not last longer than two months whereat loud cheers . On 30 August ,  Amery was saying how glad he was that Hailsham was outside the government ;  I can look to him as an ally in helping to bring the thing to a conclusion reasonably soon .  The next day ,  Beaverbrook  ( who ,  with Amery ,  had been among those who had helped bring down the Lloyd George coalition in 1922 )  strongly urged Amery to work closely with Hailsham both to keep the positive campaign going and decide when the critical moment should come for putting an end to the Coalition .

Snowden ,  unlike Samuel ,  was willing to agree in late September to a prohibitive tariff on luxury goods .  On 26 September , before the Cabinet had seriously begun to consider whether an election should be called , Snowden declared that an early election could not be avoided ; and on 2 October , Neville Chamberlain <head>noted</head> in his diary , Snowden expressed strongly the view that imports must be controlled . There is some evidence that it was Snowden who suggested the formula of the doctor 's  mandate ,  at a Cabinet meeting on 5 October ,  under which the component parts of the National Government were each to issue their own manifestos ,  with a separate personal appeal from the Prime Minister ,  According to Neville Chamberlain ,  Snowden produced the suggestion that the Prime Minister should issue his own manifesto asking for a free hand i.e. on tariffs and the two Party leaders should each issue their own programmes and to our astonishment this was at once accepted by the Liberals ,   ' Amery ,  who perhaps got the information from Chamberlain ,  wrote in his diary on 6 October ,  Apparently when the deadlock seemed most complete Snowden suggested that the PM should issue his own manifesto ,  each of the other party leaders issuing theirs .  ' Tom Jones ,  whose source was Lothian ,  also said that the formula was Snowden 's  .  It is ironic that ,  after the National majority had been safely won ,  and shown itself ,  as might have been predicted ,  protectionist ,  Snowden reverted to the role of stubborn free trader ,  and gave currency to  the view of MacDonald as a feeble halfwit ,  without principles or dignity ,  Yet MacDonald ,  although no doctrinaire free trader ,  had fought harder to reach a formula that the Liberals ,  Snowden 's  free trade allies ,  could accept than Snowden himself had done .

The new Civil Aviation Bill was passed by Parliament in August 1946 .  As the British moved to create a new regime for their airlines after the war ,  the outstanding unresolved issue from the Chicago conference remained :  the need for an Anglo - American air transport agreement .  As <head>noted</head> above , the USA pursued bilateral rights with many European , Latin American , and Middle Eastern countries , using the so - called Chicago form and in all cases insisting on fifth freedom rights . The British attempted on occasion to forestall this ,  provoking considerable anger in Washington .  Anglo - American talks were held in London on 24 August 1945 in an effort to break the deadlock ,  but were unsuccessful .

On the other hand ,  there is the possibility that one of the differing patterns of ideas may not be Conservatism .  This last point never occurs to Honderich ,  who equates Conservatism with the new right .  Yet it is worth <head>noting</head> that one of the most influential works in the canon of the new right , Friedrich Hayek 's The Constitution of Liberty , ends with a chapter entitled Why I am not a Conservative . If Honderich had paid attention to clues like this he could have subjected the credentials of the new right to closer scrutiny and interrogated the development of Conservative thought with much greater sensitivity .  But Honderich is too busy allocating guilt to be discriminating in his investigations ,  with the usual result that one cannot be sure if the right people have been convicted .

Between 1912 and 1914 the Conservative Party was distinctly unsettled .  Disgruntled Conservative agriculturalists and imperialists resented Bonar Law 's  dropping of the food taxes in the winter of 191213 ,  and although he survived the initial furore sparked by this decision it was not clear that the ill feeling had been fully dissipated or his leadership wholly secured .  As <head>noted</head> by Fforde , the question of how to respond to the Land Campaign threw the Conservatives into fresh disagreements , and there was no sign that the party , Having abandoned much of its 1910 election platform , was capable of agreeing upon a new one . In many ways the Conservatives '  descent towards violence over the Ulster question ,  and Bonar Law 's  new style .  which seemed to consist mainly of abusing Asquith ,  were symptomatic of the party 's  inability to discover a real sense of direction .

None the less ,  irrespective of what their position might be ,  modern anthropology would reject the view that the progress of technology is totally irreversible ,  although the sequence of technological progress Marx and Engels took over from their anthropological sources is still ,  by and large ,  acceptable .  The problem with their evolutionary sequence does not lie so much with what they say about technology as what they saw this technology as implying .  Before we examine these problems one important question of method must be <head>noted</head> . Marx and Engels ,  like all their contemporaries ,  including anthropologists and archaeologists and Morgan in particular ,  felt that information gained about contemporary peoples whose life depended on a simple technology was valid for understanding the social institutions of prehistoric populations who had relied on a similar technology .  For example ,  if the Bushmen of the Kalahari ,  who live by hunting and gathering ,  accord a high status to women this ,  it was assumed ,  must also have been true of the hunters and gatherers of prehistoric times .

Their lives were therefore presumably very much easier and different from that of Bushmen .  Because of this fundamental difference it is difficult to know whether we can rely on information about  contemporaries to tell us about prehistoric peoples in the way that is often done still today and was done universally in Marx 's  and Engels 's  time .  The significance of the objections we have just <head>noted</head> is much more important than might at first appear . These objections imply that technology cannot be a guide to other aspects of society ,  or in other words that there is no inevitable association between technology and other aspects of society .  This qualification applies as much to the work of writers such as Morgan as to his critics .

He also presents us with a fairly strict unilineal theory of evolution ,   ( if we forget about the difference between the New and the Old Worlds )  .  The other area of doubt concerns a question whether the same laws of historical development apply to the whole history of mankind or whether different ,  simpler laws apply to primitive societies .  This , as we have <head>noted</head> , is closely linked to the question whether something like classes have always existed , because the Marxist theory of history centres around the notion of class . If ,  as Engels assumes in The Origin  ,  primitive societies contained no inequality ,  then it would follow ,  according to Marxist thought ,  that a different ,  simpler theory of history would apply for these societies .  If ,  on the other hand ,  something like classes had always existed ,  as assumed in The German Ideology  ,  the first edition of The Communist Manifesto  ,  and Formen  ,  then the principles developed by Marx in Capital  could be made to apply to all societies .

We have already outlined the evidence  ( Chapter 1 and 2 )  that the rhythms of fatigue and body temperature have both external and internal causes .  for alertness  ( or fatigue )  the evidence must be based upon subjective measurements ,  but ,  for body temperature ,  objective measurements are possible .  It will have been <head>noted</head> that the rhythms of body temperature and alertness are timed very similarly with higher values in the daytime and lower values at night ( compare figs 1.2 and 1.3 ) .

One gets the feeling from Warnie 's  diary ,  for example ,  that it was better to be a good Inkling than a good poet ,  or even a good man. The most exaggerated example of this  ( it was the dangerous tendency which Jack himself labelled the Inner Ring )  was when they attended a production of Hamlet  at the New Theatre in Oxford ,  produced  as were so many great Oxford University Dramatic Society productions in the middle years of this century  by Nevill Coghill .  What dramatic merit the play had , Warnie <head>noted</head> afterwards , seemed to have been supplied by Coghill and not by Shakespeare .

Anthropological modes of enquiry are therefore programmed to steer us through the assumptions of police society ,  so that contradictions no longer remain incomprehensible .  The cultural baggage which any social group ,  tribe ,  or institution such as the police acquires over time can thus be translated to reveal just what sustains it ,  and furthermore reveal what the society itself may not even have understood .  Where there does exist a genuine public expression of concern about the way the police <head>operate</head> this cannot just be dismissed as a matter of misunderstanding or be written off as the foolish ramblings of that police folk devil the loony left , who would dismantle the system for their own political ends . Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,  it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,  it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,  which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .

There have been some events which give qualified cause for optimism .  Perhaps most important is the development of a Mothers Front to campaign for investigations into the mass disappearances .  Modelled on similar <head>organizations</head> in Argentina and Central America , it consists mainly of mothers whose husbands , sons and daughters have disappeared or are known to have been murdered by the government or the JVP . Although headed by opposition MPs ,  it has grown independently on a national basis and held its first large scale rally in Colombo in late February 1991 .  Based in the Sinhalese south of the island ,  the Mothers '  Front has nonetheless stated its intention to embrace those affected by the thousands of disappearances in the Tamil - dominated areas of the north and east of the country .

The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 .  The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal organization representing protestant trade unionists .  But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party <head>organization</head> , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists , which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united , independent Ireland . It was only with the Troubles ,  from 1968 ,  that unionists  broke ranks .  Yet ,  despite the splintering ,  they have succeeded in allying the present two main parties against the Anglo - Irish agreement of 1985 .

What the protestant loyalists in effect seek to maintain is protestant  loyalist domination within a flexible territory ,  one which they feel justified in calling their land and ruling according to their conscience .  The Key Mythical Structures of Protestant  Loyalist Popular Religion It could be argued that the myths of Ulster protestantism and the institution of the Orange order take the place of the more centralized clerical <head>organization</head> of Roman catholicism in providing some element of overall religious unity among protestant loyalists . By myth is meant here what has generally come to be accepted within sociology and social anthropology since the work of Levi - Strauss :  an account of the origins of a society or of particular crucial events in its life ,  which unite the cosmos to the social structure by actively shaping everyday life perceptions .  The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a  faith consciousness .

Returning to academia he can recall the spatial remove as being out there in the field ;  so that much of the current anthropology at home may still only be practising in its own backyard ,  pursuing an exploration of exotic cultures at home rather than looking into its own front room  ( Cheater 1987 :  166 )  .  Sarsby ,   ( 1984 :  1301 )  echoing Cheater ,  points out that anthropologists have tended to study people whose values and life - styles are different ,  even in their own society seeking the unfamiliar at home as well as abroad .  An assumption remains inherent in the literature that anthropology is academically based , funded by some research <head>organization</head> , presented in seminar , taught to students , and then written up and published . It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education  ( Sarsby 1984 :  132 )  and has only recently begun to surface in policy and practice .  As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,  the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .

It can be quite painful ,  for the insider is studying his own social navel ,  with the potential always present that he will recognize this to be only one of a number of arbitrary possibilities and perhaps also find that many practices are built on the flimsiest of moral precepts .  Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,  for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,  bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface , for no power - based <head>organization</head> likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public , and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic . Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition ,  for as the revelations of Spycatcher   ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 )  revealed ,  it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ;  rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various arms of the executive to say nothing about their practices .  This returns us to Arendt 's  observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism ,  for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .

The observing participant insider is consequently torn between self and scientism ,  for he knows the strengths of an inculcated approval for quality of restraint which sustains the police mind .  It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that most insider participant observation of policing is almost always confined to discussion on management techniques and to the implementation of new systems .  Philosophical reflexivity is not high on the agenda and in an <head>organization</head> which makes much of the concept of loyalty but really means subservience , the insider can find it hard to bite the hand that feeds and reveal any unhealthy aspect in the agenda . When the research is carried out by academics from outside ,  critical analysis creates enormous tensions .  Barrie Irving ,  director of the Police Foundation ,  indicated this antipathy in his title to a paper given to the British Psychological Society ,   Research into Policy wo n't go  ( 1983 )  .

As Crick  ( 1976 :  123 )  has argued ,  criminology  ( like anthropology )  ,  is largely concerned with systems of classification .  In consequence ,  police modes of thought build up into classifiable systems of praxis which are the product of dealing with the extremes of social experience .  These in turn become massively overdetermined , regenerative and self - justifying , creating an institutional mind which , although allegedly acting on behalf of society and the majority population , comes to regard that same group as outsiders and potential antagonists who are never to be accorded easy access to the processes of the <head>organization</head> . Such a world view is the product of a perception conceptualized to contend dramatically with the instant experience of dealing with highly emotive ,  personal conflicts at street level ,  or the tensions of ritual battles with criminals .  Inevitably in such circumstances ,  the detail of practice suffers a reduction to enable these charged and emotional situations to be handled more easily and to allow the complexities of social events to be reduced to the simplicities of narrative necessary for the file of evidence .

Police culture is omnipotent is structuring such views of critical research .  Historically it has homed in on sociology as the generic symbol of reformatory zealousness ,  regarding its practitioners almost as folk devils or bogeymen .  Such a view of sociology sets up another binary derived from the police preference for a Manichaean world created on homologies of good evil , and further reflects the ferocious resistance to and fear of change which permeates the <head>organization</head> ( see for example Weatheritt 1986 , Butler 1984 , and Adams 1988 ) . Certainly the social sciences are seen to be the arbiters of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and its processes ,  and this has led it to negate the reforming social scientists ,  keeping them as outsiders beyond the system .  A further example from the Police Foundation Oxford Conference gives some indication of the different perspectives which exist for the analytic researcher and the practical policeman :

For over a decade I lived with this new knowledge and with the ethical dilemma surrounding my own pursuit of insider research .  During the creation of a doctoral thesis and preparation of papers for seminars ,  I had to face the conscious problem of writing about a system which I know  prefers silence and links such reticence to ideas of respect ,  order ,  and discipline in an all - encompassing paternalism .  And of course I knew that this hierarchical <head>organization</head> offers the possibility of reward and incorporation into the highest ranks to those who conform to such dictates . The dilemma followed me through the publication of a few accounts of my researches .

One of the consequences of the RUC 's  dual role is that it has features typical of most police forces and qualities special to it .  This is reflected in the respondents '  sensitivity towards the police management ,  an enduring theme in the conversation of ordinary policemen and women in any force ,  and towards the terrorist threat ,  which is not faced by others to the same degree .  The latter makes what is already an internally homogeneous <head>organization</head> even more enclosed and protective . As one constable put it ,  I do n't mind you being here ,  I do n't mind you taking notes .  I do n't mind you at all ,  but the boys they 'd be suspicious of anyone who 's  not a member of the police force ,  and that 's  how people will see you :  you 're not a member of the force  ( FN 23/10/87 ,  p. 20 )  .

This declaration proved to be premature ,  although a recommendation that there should be a longer term for the candidate stage towards full party membership must have provided a useful mechanism for sifting the wheat from the chaff .

Indeed since eight of the eleven cell members were not peasants ,  they probably fell easily into this view of their own roles .

All local funds ,  which had been cut as a result of the introduction of NEP ,  were poured into famine relief .  There was even less money available for education after September ,  when many new famine duties and financial burdens were shifted from Moscow on to local authorities .

Churches ,  like the schools ,  were abandoned .  The government 's  anti - religious campaign in connection with the Church 's  alleged refusal to donate money and valuables for the Famine crippled the reputation of church aid and made some priests unwilling to become entangled in relief work .

Eliot instances the activities of Dyak headhunters the production of whose carvings is at once a task utilitarian and sacred .

Eliot moves from such a primitive <head>organization</head> to discussing Greek drama , following the movement of Harrison , Cornford , and the other anthropologically influenced classical scholars whom he had read . He sees that conflict between various elements in highly developed society can be creative ,  but that eventually deterioration will follow if connections are not preserved between the various areas of life which ,  in the primitive model ,  are integrated .  Without naming names ,  he goes on to outline the situations which had so interested him in the cases of the Melanesians and the Tari Furora ,  as he points out that to tamper with the pattern of primitive culture at one point is to endanger the whole structure .

Fforde locates the rise of collectivism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century ,  equates collectivism with socialism ,  and views collectivism as symptomatic of the triumph of materialism .  All of this has a distinctly Diceyesque ring ,  for in the introduction to the 1913 edition of his Law and Public Opinion  Dicey portrayed any extension of state activity as socialist ,  and denounced the welfare collectivism of the new liberalism as an attempt to bribe the electorate with state benefits .  However , Fforde 's acceptance of Dicey 's basic agenda reveals the weakness of his central argument , a weakness which is confirmed by his comment that the LPDL , an <head>organization</head> with which Dicey had close links , espoused the pure milk of Conservative orthodoxy . Fforde 's  error  ( and Eccleshall makes the same mistake )  is simply that the orthodoxy which Dicey and his friends in the LPDL espoused was not Conservatism but classical mid - Victorian Liberalism .  It is true that Dicey ,  the LPDL ,  and later the BCA ,  allied themselves with the Conservative party ,  but this was not because they considered themselves Conservatives .

For example ,  Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,  are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,  and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .  On issues like this Coetzee 's  sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect :  but with regard to the broader historical significance of these organizations he is less assured ,  and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work .  The leitmotif of Coetzee 's book , as suggested by his title , is that the <head>organizations</head> he has studied faced an ongoing dilemma : whether to function as adjuncts of the Conservative party or to claim that their aims were national and therefore above party . In fact ,  as Coetzee demonstrates ,  the personnel of the TRL ,  the NL ,  and the ASU were predominantly Conservative ,  and in this respect their claim to be non - party was always weak .  Yet Coetzee also makes clear that ,  for two reasons ,  the non - party idea should be taken seriously .

The Conservative  Party was thus preserved intact ,  and the fact that it was able to provide a rallying point for the middle and lower middle classes was arguably one of the main bulwarks against political extremism in the 1920s and 1930s .  At this juncture a codicil must be inserted .  The above argument is predicated on Coetzee 's assumption that the disruptive potential of the new <head>organizations</head> had been contained and that the crisis of Conservatism was over before 1914 . Yet it is not obvious that this was the case .  Between 1912 and 1914 the Conservative Party was distinctly unsettled .

Marx carried the criticism of Hegel 's  position much further ,  and he is equally critical of the young Hegelians .  He argues that ,  far from the State being the prime mover of history ,  the State itself is simply an aspect of a particular type of society .  What Marx meant by a particular society was an <head>organization</head> of people making a living together . In this perspective political reform of the State was therefore largely irrelevant since what had to be reformed was the complex order of which the State and law were only epiphenomena .  By arguing this ,  Marx therefore redefined the task of the revolutionary .

This Germanic organization remains extremely vague in Formen  and the reason seems to come from the paucity and dubiousness of Marx 's  sources for the construction of this mode of production .  In The German Ideology  Marx had used Tacitus as his source for tribal German society ,  but by the time of Formen  he became influenced by the nationalist and romantic nineteenth - century tradition of German historiography ,  a tradition which was to influence him even more later on ,  and which was to have a dramatic and harmful effect on Engels .  This tradition stressed how true Germanic society was still to be found in the <head>organization</head> of ancient local communities . It was egalitarian and free from the weakening and divisive influence of the Roman world and of urban society .  Within the local community it had survived during the Middle Ages and even to a certain extent right up to the nineteenth century ,  in spite of a foreign overlay of feudal institutions coming from western and southern Europe .

One very significant change from Morgan we can attribute to Marx .  Morgan 's  work is divided into four parts :  1 The growth of intelligence through inventions and discoveries ,  which deals in great part with agricultural technology ;  2 the growth of the idea of government ,  which is mainly a discussion of descent groups and how they ultimately give way to state organization ,  particularly the Roman state ;  3 the growth of the idea of the family ,  largely a discussion of types of marriage and types of kinship terminology ;  and finally 4 the growth of the idea of property .  Marx in his notes changes this order and brings the discussion of property forward into the discussion of descent groups and family <head>organization</head> , while he keeps the discussion of the rise of the State till last . This new order accords with the logic of Marx 's  thinking ,  as we have seen it in all the works we have discussed so far .  It also forms the basis of the organization of Engels 's  book .

There is however an implied point in the discussion of the gens which ,  I believe ,  is justified in all societies principally organized by descent group  ( though not necessarily all societies where descent groups merely occur as one among many other social institutions )  .  In such societies one does not find internal differentiation based on differential wealth ,  and if such differentiation appears to develop ,  it is resisted .  This means that in a very general way there is a contradiction between class <head>organization</head> and descent groups , and that this contradiction is actually perceived , though not in theoretical terms , by the members of societies based on descent groups . The exaggeration or over - simplification of the notion of commonality within the gens as regards ownership of property is also apparent in the discussion of kinship and this led equally to a fundamental misunderstanding .  In part Morgan believed that ,  in systems based on descent groups ,  spouses were held in common because ,  in such a society ,  people often talk of wives or husbands as having been married to such and such a gens .

The Department of the Environment provided just such a draft when they invited the Prince ,  as the United Kingdom 's  patron of the European Year of the Environment ,  to open the Second International Conference on the protection of the North Sea in November 1987 .  It was a prestigious event ,  attended by ministers and top delegates from all over Europe ,  and the speech delivered to the Prince 's  office was straightforward and bland ,  essentially a pat on the back for Britain in all she was doing to keep the North Sea clean .

A great many green ideas were produced by Labour that summer ;  a green bill to show up the deficiencies in Tory legislation ;  making the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local elections ;  the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental ,  countryside and energy organizations .  The Trades Union Congress weighed in with a Green Charter ,  which included the right to hold green strikes over issues like the importation of toxic wastes .  But by the end of the year the green bill had been quietly dropped and the environmental network had vanished into a general belief in the need for good , informal relations with Friends of the Earth and other environmental <head>organizations</head> . It was no longer necessary to upstage the Green Party ;  and it was becoming harder ,  too ,  to find a straightforward ,  easily defined green issue on which to challenge the Tories .  Mrs Thatcher had established her environmentalist credentials in several speeches and had replaced the true - blue but ungreen Nicholas Ridley with the practically viridescent Chris Patten as Environment Secretary .

They recalled that in 1958 Quakers had made an unsuccessful attempt to interrupt atmospheric testing of H - bombs at Bikini atoll in the Pacific .

Constituency parties were formed for all the major industrial constituencies .  The rather amorphous Huddersfield Labour movement was transformed into the more clearly defined Huddersfield Divisional Labour Party in the spring and summer of 1918 .

From 1917 onwards ,  many referred to the need for proportional representation and some charged the Labour Party with fomenting class warfare through its parliamentary and municipal campaigns .

The Spanish Medical Aid Committee reviewing the situation at the end of the first year had sent out forty - seven ambulances ,  eighty trained personnel ,  had constructed two base hospitals and several field hospitals and had set up a convalescent home  the Ralph Fox Memorial Home in memory of a well - known author and critic who had died in action in Spain during 1936 .  About ten months later ,  in a report to an  International Congress at Paris it was stated that the Spanish Medical Aid Committee had helped to set up nineteen hospitals throughout Republican Spain ,  some front - line hospitals and seventy - two ambulances .  There were in fact many <head>organizations</head> supplying help to the Republican government . They raised money in a variety of ways ,  from auctioning sketches of Picasso 's  Guernica  to showing ,  up and down the country ,  the films The Defence of Madrid and Spanish Earth  .

The effectiveness of the Labour Spain Committee was impaired both by the fact that it was  was  associated with the movement in the constituency Labour parties and also because it was effectively advocating a  a  popular front against fascism ,  which the Labour Party continued to reject throughout the 1930s ;  after the political disasters of 1931 it wanted no treating with its political enemies whether of the left or the right .  The Labour Party leadership also felt that the British people were not ,  as yet ,  ready for war :  In Great Britain the position was that no Government would be able to secure public support for any action which the people believed would lead to war .   Nevertheless , whilst a joint campaign with the Communist Party and other political <head>organizations</head> was entirely out of the question , the Labour leadership felt compelled to adjust its policy with regard to Spain . Shortly after the Edinburgh Conference ,  the National Council of Labour ,  which brought the executives of the TUC and the Labour Party together ,  agreed that the Spanish government should have its commercial rights restored .  By June 1937 the National Council of Labour ,  effectively speaking for the Labour Party ,  decided to reverse its Edinburgh policy and to oppose non - intervention .

The new town development was not sited on Londonderry but between the largely Protestant towns of Lurgan and Portadown .  Certainly one would have to agree that O'Neill did little to change either the reality or Catholic perceptions of their subordinate position in the polity and the economy but his failure almost certainly owed more to his lack of power than to his lack of desire .  Farrell uses the fact that O'Neill joined the Apprentice Boys of Derry and the Royal Black Preceptory ( two Protestant fraternal <head>organizations</head> similar to the Orange Order ) to portray him as a closet die - hard unionist but in so doing misses the glaring point that O'Neill had to join these organizations because he was not already a member . Any genuinely orthodox unionist would have been a member since late adolescence !  O'Neill 's  suspect views were known to many unionists and the conservatives did not have to wait for the fruits of O'Neillism ,  however timid they may have been .

O'Neill 's  minor reforms or ,  as Utley perceptively describes it ,  his government by gesture i served only to politicize further the frustration of the Catholic population ,  without making it any more committed to the Northern Ireland state .  O'Neill also failed to appreciate the extent of Protestant misgivings ,  preferring instead to see Paisley and his supporters as a small and unrepresentative rabble .  Dismissing Paisley 's support as a fascist <head>organization</head> masquerading under the cloak of religion deluding a lot of sincere people hell - bent on provoking religious strife in Northern Ireland , he seemed unprepared for the reaction against him within his own party . While attempting to respond to the civil rights movement and to the pressure from the Wilson government in London ,  O'Neill was being threatened from within the Unionist camp .  Although the first revolt was crushed ,  Desmond Boal could still raise thirteen Unionist backbenchers '  signatures for the removal of O'Neill ,  and Lord Brookeborough ,  only three years after handing the premiership to O'Neill ,  was leading a whispering campaign against him.

In March of the following year ,  when the feuding between the UDA and the UVF reached the point of tit - for - tat assassination ,  Paisley called on Protestants to withdraw all support from the paramilitaries and accused them of committing crimes just as heinous and hellish as those of the IRA .  Fred Procter ,  by then a DUP Belfast city councillor ,  was shot ,  apparently by the UVF ,  who objected to his spirited criticisms of  gangsterism on the Shankill Road .  The fighting between the UVF and UDA , and the struggles for power within the UDA , did much to damage the reputation of the working - class loyalist <head>organizations</head> and to permit the professional politicians to regain control after the UWC strike . What also helped to undermine their credibility were the claims that the UDA and UVF were socialist or communist .  Few accusations ,  if they can be made to stick ,  are more damaging in the context of Northern Irish politics where leftism has traditionally been associated with nationalism .

Whatever initial reasons people had for being attracted to Ian Paisley as a politician ,  the main reason for their support was their commitment to the principles he enunciated .  In the end they were committed ,  as he was ,  to the preservation of a Protestant Ulster ,  to the suppression of what they saw as a republican rebellion ,  and to the restoration of majority rule in Northern Ireland .  The leaders and the activists were no doubt also motivated by personal ambition and by a jealous regard for their own <head>organizations</head> but , at various crisis points , many were willing to subordinate their own ambitions to the greater goal of saving Ulster .

It should be clear from the preceding chapters that the Free Presbyterian Church is no ordinary evangelical sect  ( using that term in its sociological rather than pejorative sense )  .  The political crisis which vastly increased its recruitment could not help but give it an unusual character .  Other religious organizations , such as the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa , have played important parts in providing religious legitimation for political ideologies , but few modern churches have had so many of their personnel actively involved in one particular political <head>organization</head> . This close association of religion and politics has also given the organizational vehicle for the politics  the DUP  an unusual character which I now wish to explore by examining the tensions caused by the presence in a political agenda of religious attitudes .

A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum ,  that is to say a show of recent work ,  through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition .  We have already looked at writing in catalogues ,  and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles .  The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears , as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's dismissal from the New York Times because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the <head>paper</head> 's readers . The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .

Bishop Cahal Daly has argued  that the debate on multi - denominational schools has effectively taken people 's  attention away from the central issues in Northern Ireland ,  namely social injustice ,  fundamental political inequality ,  and the violence .  In reaction to this ,  one can say that the very way in which the church leaders view the subject is itself revealing of significant mediations between religion ,  state ,  and national ideology in the institutions of schooling .  In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning , with social scientists also contributing to <head>papers</head> and discussions . What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too :  the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some degree protected from it .  In this writer 's  view ,  the arguments against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .

Philosophical reflexivity is not high on the agenda and in an organization which makes much of the concept of loyalty but really means subservience ,  the insider can find it hard to bite the hand that feeds and reveal any unhealthy aspect in the agenda .

Barrie Irving , director of the Police Foundation , indicated this antipathy in his title to a <head>paper</head> given to the British Psychological Society , Research into Policy wo n't go ( 1983 ) . He told his audience that C.I.D .  officers use deception ,  trickery and psychologically oriented persuasive tactics amounting to threats and inducements ,  in order to obtain confessions ;  and this process is potentiated by the custodial environment .

The vast  library on police matters was clearly under - used and there is obviously a need for a critical ethnography of the college itself ,  for it takes in numbers of senior and middle police managers each year ,  maintains a considerable staff of academics and visiting lecturers ,  but has singularly failed to provide an academically stimulating university of policing .  Even the civilian academics at the college seem to be nullified by the overriding police desire for circumspection in the written account and the preference for academic silence .  It could be anticipated that the college would have seen the creation of a continuous stream of books and <head>papers</head> generated by the rich source of material which pours through its gates , but this has hardly been the case . Two books in the recent past  ( Pope and Weiner 1981 and Thackrah 1985 )  both contain veiled indications of the problems these civil service academics encounter when they write about the police .  In a forward to Modern Policing   ( Pope and Weiner ibid .  )  ,

Our peers included our recent colleagues of yesterday in uniform and in the CID ,  but also took in the professor of psychiatry ,  the Home Office Drugs Branch official ,  the NHS executive ,  the sociologist ,  and the media hack .  Ours was now a multiple reality and our structural ambivalence can be illustrated by one example when one of the squad created a blazer badge in heraldic style  ( although we could never have been seen in a blazer at this time when faded denim was the order of the day )  .  This badge had crossed hypodermic syringes and a Latin motto which when translated , read : Bodies in the cells , names in the <head>papers</head> . The blazer badge reinforced the capture of bodies philosophy which had sustained our earlier lives ,  but was created at the same time that I was compiling a paper for presentation at the national BMA police surgeons '  conference .  I believe they came to hear jolly conference stories about drug fiends and acid heads ,  but the paper concluded :

Everyone filed out ,  pushing a little ,  finding it hard to maintain their Sunday solemnity .

Cameron caught sight of young McCulloch from Weem ,  standing beside Jean Bruce with his arm round her waist .  He shouldered towards them and asked ,  What is going on ?

Benjamin Libet of the University of California at San Francisco has been responsible for two sets of experiments which are often cited as crucial evidence in the debate about the relationship between brain and mind .  In 1979 he published a <head>paper</head> showing that the perception evoked by stimulating the skin or the neural pathway between the skin and the cortex was reported by the subject as occurring a few hundred milliseconds before the cortical ERP was sufficiently complete to generate that perception . In earlier work ,  he and others had established that the cortical - evoked potential ,  and also direct cortical stimulation ,  had to persist for several hundred milliseconds  before subjects reported feeling anything .  Then in the 1979 paper he found that subjects placed the time of occurrence of this sensation only a few milliseconds after the peripheral stimulus which evoked it .

The Commission concludes that the community charge will become harder to collect and that every effort should be made to introduce the new tax in April 1993 .  However ,  the timetable for the council tax is tight and will only be achievable if lessons are learnt from the introduction of the community charge .  The Commission believes that the abolition of the 20 % minimum contribution will ease the administrative burden , but notes that the consultation <head>paper</head> is vague on a number of administrative details . The paper also comments on the low proportion of expenditure to be raised through local taxation and the high gearing on tax rises .  Gearing refers to the increase in bills caused by authorities raising spending above their Standard Spending Assessments  ( SSAs )  .

Events and tendencies are bigger than he is ,  and while not shaky in himself he gets dealt the final shove of murder .  ( ii )

She has good reason to be pleased .  She has done something ,  something on a different plane from making a toy church or pipping a social rival at the post or committing a mindless atrocity .

Nor does it get us anywhere to learn from Anna Dostoevsky 's  Memoirs  that the story of the frantic Shatov ,  where phrasing seems inevitable and images unsought  it does n't help to be told by the novelist 's  widow that these flawless pages lean heavily on his own behaviour while their first child was being born .

Having crossed the Siemens '  Brothers homeland ,  it  then clipped through a southern corner of Russia heading for Tehran ,  where it had its only interconnection before continuing on to the Indian sub - continent .  In the course of construction engineers and technicians survived fearful seas ;  had been protected by Russian soldiers ;  used ,  along with their equipment ,  as a form of target practice by turbulent natives and  on an individual level  had fallen victim to a positively bewildering variety of exotic diseases .

Cable code signals  three - condition signals  were sent to line via the siphon recorder and its shunts SS1 and RSI giving pulse working to the distant terminal where the received signals passed through the recorder coils ,  the high - resistance inductive shunt RS2 to earth ,  via SR2 .  In 1870 however ,  the brilliant Sir Charles Wheatstone invented the first ,  effective automatic telegraph equipment .  The message to be sent was transposed corresponding to the dot/dash Morse code of the message into perforations on a <head>paper</head> tape ( Fig. 4 ) . The tape was then passed through an automatic transmitter ,  turning individual perforations into dot/dash signals for the line and considerably improving speed of the telegraph .  The first Atlantic cable operated at a speed of around 3 words/min ,  equating to a bandwidth of about 1.5Hz/s .

By DAVID MCKITTRICK ,  Ireland Correspondent First Edition THE ALLEGATION that the Royal Ulster Constabulary contains an Inner Circle of officers preparing private lists of IRA suspects and working against the Anglo - Irish agreement has lent a new dimension to the security force - loyalist collusion saga .  The claim came in yesterday 's Irish News , Belfast 's Catholic morning <head>paper</head> .

View from City Road :  Smurfit late with good news By SIMON PINCOMBE JEFFERSON SMURFIT is winning no friends this side of the Irish Sea despite its undoubted skills in the <head>paper</head> and packaging business . Yesterday it announced figures for the first half of 1989 so late in the day that the London market had mostly packed up and gone home by the time the screens showed that profits had risen from Ir 109m to Ir 121m and earnings were up from 21.7p to 25.4p basic .  The City put the shares up 4p to 565p ,  but that seems to have been largely on the basis of the optimistic tone of the statement and the general state of the market than from any in - depth analysis of the figures .

Letter :  The real Pharisees From Rabbi JOHN D. RAYNER Sir : While tending to agree with the Archbishop of Canterbury 's social critique as reported in your <head>paper</head> ( 'Runcie attack on Pharisees revives rift with Tories ' , 2 October ) , I find his reference to the Pharisees more than a little unfortunate . For about 100 years Jewish and Christian scholars have demonstrated over and over again that the stereotype of the Pharisees found in the Gospels is a distortion which reflects the animosity of the Evangelists rather than the historical truth or even the attitude of Jesus himself .  Far from being inclined towards self - righteousness ,  the Pharisees taught Be humble before all men ,  and revered their teacher Hillel for his extreme humility ;  and far from being judgemental ,  they urged Do not judge your fellow man until you are in his position and Always judge others by the scale of merit  ( that is ,  charitably )  .

West Germany 's  actions are utterly shortsighted ,  wrote Pravda in the guise of a commentary by its correspondent in East Berlin .  They were an assault on the stability in the centre of Europe ,  in which every nation of our continent places its hopes .  What the <head>paper</head> scathingly called the story of the refugees had been whipped up by a noisy propaganda campaign dripping with chauvinism and nationalism . And behind the West German media stood the country 's  politicians ,  nursing illusions about the recreation of a new German Reich with the pre - war frontiers of 1937 .  Such language is infinitely more virulent that anything emanating from the Soviet foreign ministry after the deal four days ago between Bonn and East Berlin ,  which allowed some some 5,000 East Germans who had taken shelter in the two embassies to leave unmolested for the West .

In the 1950s and 1960s the royal castles were examined in detail by various authorities ,  but it was the great baronial buildings in Wales that attracted King .  From the 1950s through to the early 1980s he published an important series of papers ,  the majority in the Cambrian Archaeological Association 's  Archaeologia Cambrensis ,  notably on the Pembrokeshire castles of Carew ,  Manorbier and Pembroke ,  and the native Welsh castles of Dinas Bran and Caergwrle in the north of the principality .  At the same time as he was working on individual buildings , King produced his lists of all the castles in Wales and the Marches , as well as more detailed <head>papers</head> on the counties of Breconshire and Cardiganshire . His fieldwork in England and Wales led him to visit virtually every castle with visible remains ,  from humble earthwork upwards ,  culminating in the publication of his Castellarium Anglicanum  ( 1983 )  .  This two - volume work details all the castles built in England and Wales ,  and reference will always be made to it as long as castles are studied .

The press ,  at Ivry ,  a suburb south - east of Paris ,  is the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64 - page newspaper ,  a third as much again .  With so many pages ,  the decision to divide the paper into separate sections :  home and foreign news ,  society and culture ,  economics and business news with special supplements ,  books and ideas on Friday ,  arts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekend ,  has been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything else .  The <head>paper</head> was just getting too unwieldly , we needed to give our readers some help in finding their way around the paper , says Mr Fontaine . He also hopes the new format will attract new readers ,  both those who do not regularly read a daily newspaper and converts from the rival Liberation  -  which has won an extraordinary success among younger readers with its mix of lively writing ,  news features and bold use of photography and design .  Mr Fontaine admits that the society and culture section of the new - look Le Monde has been inspired by Liberation 's  treatment of similar subject - matter .

Not all the Le Monde journalists support the change ,  which is the result of two years '  market research and several dummy editions .  A professional designer ,  Jean Bayle ,  with a track record for breathing new life into tired titles ,  was hired but the changes he favoured were deemed rather too radical and ,  in the end  as is often the case on Le Monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company  the consensus view prevailed .  For the chief sub - editor , Daniel Vernet , it has not been an easy transition : We had to make sure that the <head>paper</head> read as a single publication , but that each section stood up on its own , while avoiding undue repetition , he explains . All this disruption coincides with preparations to move to a new offices early next month ,  when all editing and layout will be done on computers .  Meanwhile ,  there are plans to change the management structure so as to divide responsibility for editorial content ,  day - to - day management and the business side of the Le Monde publishing empire more logically .

Cookie ( 15 ) is a disappointment , for its credentials look promising on <head>paper</head> .

The postwar generation ,  unschooled in the brutality of hardships of war and reconstruction ,  compares its lot with that of West Germans ,  with double their standard of living ,  rather than with their neighbours to the East ,  to whom the mountains of sausages and pigs '  trotters in butchers '  shops would seem like a dream come true .  Forty years on ,  there is ,  at best ,  a consensus of boredom with the virulent attacks against allegedly renascent fascism ,  and the endlessly invoked Achievements .  Yesterday , Achievements marched up and down the grey columns of the party <head>paper</head> Neues Deutschland with more than usual determination . The solid education system ,  full if unexciting shops ,  the fact that East Germany is socialism 's  only economic miracle ,  ranking among the world 's  top 10 industrial countries  it all bores people unspeakably ,  as much as those triumphal lists of foreign dignitaries attending today 's  ceremonies ,  and the constant reminder that 135 countries recognise the 1945 Soviet occupation zone as a second German state .  But so do many of the opposition groups here ,  entertaining a touching if economically illiterate faith in a third way which would involve neither reunification nor a return to capitalism .

In many cases ,  this form of guaranteed sales is running at barely half that of 1989 ,  when the boom was such that the government was forced to drop limits on subscriptions ,  which it claimed were forced upon it by lack of newsprint .

For Trud , the union <head>paper</head> which claims the largest daily sale of close to 20 million , the figure is 54 per cent . Both liberal and conservative publications have been hit .

But no one associated with the pending 500m  ( 312m )  sale would say whether the West German government has yet indicated its final approval .

On <head>paper</head> , however , the vessels would be on the order of the United States , enabling Israel to receive American financing and circumventing West German export restrictions .

The national executive 's consultation <head>paper</head> suggests a trade union/constituency party split of 70/30 . One variation on that would be to increase the constituency share according to the national increase in membership  so constituencies would have 30 per cent of the vote on a membership of 300,000  ( as now )  but would get an extra 1 per cent of the vote for every 30,000 increase in national membership .  Then if membership doubled ,  the balance would move to 60/40 in the unions '  favour .

I want the emotion taken out of this debate .  It may be impossible to stop the trade in ivory ,  so a compromise must be found ,  he said .  At present , trade in African ivory worth millions of dollars is allowed by CITES , under a system of quotas , with tusk markings and shipment <head>papers</head> designed to catch out sales of poached tusks . The quota system ,  which critics claim permits poached ivory to enter legal trade ,  was set up as African elephant numbers fell from an estimated 1.3 million in 1979 to about 600,000 today .  The dispute arises because poaching and habitat destruction has vastly reduced elephant herds in central and eastern Africa ,  but wildlife management further south has meant rising populations ,  which are regularly culled to raise foreign exchange .

The first floor contains <head>paper</head> sculptures he has used torn , cut , folded and painted paper to form provocative jumbles contained in plexiglass cases ; these abstract explorations of texture and form , which closely parallel his metal pieces , are attractively priced at 10,000 .

Two of the <head>papers</head> in Science came from Japan and reported on individuals suffering from Type A syndrome , a rare variant of Type 2 diabetes . In both cases it seems that the problem lay in the transmission of the activation signal across the target cell membrane ,  once insulin has bound to the surface receptor .  The activation molecule is an enzyme called tyrosine kinase and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene .

The activation molecule is an enzyme called tyrosine kinase and in both individuals this molecule was not functioning properly because they had inherited a faulty kinase gene .  But the faults in the genes and the resultant proteins were different in each case :  one producing an enzyme molecule with large structural changes ,  the other having a single amino acid change at a critical part of the molecule .  The third <head>paper</head> , from the US , reports work with rats given diabetes experimentally with the drug streptozotocin . Analysis of cells from these rats showed that drug action had interfered with the expression of genes for some of the proteins designed to move sugar into muscle and fat cells ,  exactly the target tissues which must be stimulated by insulin if they are to take up excess sugar .  This provides circumstantial evidence that some cases of human Type 2 diabetes result from a similar failure .

Market guru ,  Peter Thompson ,  now retired from Barclays de Zoete Wedd ,  but still forecasting market trends ,  has published a document predicting that the FT - SE 100 could be at 2,100 by the end of the month  ( it closed at 2,233.9 ,  down 3.9 ,  yesterday )  .  He says it will spiral down to 1,800 by next year .  Many would dismiss Peter Thompson 's pessimism out of hand were it not for the fact that he was the author of a <head>paper</head> in July 1987 , when the market was at its pre - crash high , called The End of the Long Bull Market . Market uncertainty forced Hays ,  the business services group which is seeking a stock market listing ,  to revise the launch price for its offer for sale scheduled to take place this month .  Faced with the decision of raising less money and hoping for a successful issue or shelving the flotation altogether ,  Ronnie Frost ,  chairman ,  opted for the cheaper share price .

Mr Hooker ,  a motor trade production foreman who began assembling the world 's  largest collection of grips 12 years ago ,  has seen antique fair prices for rare ones rise from a fiver ,  two or three years ago ,  to the present 20 - 30 ,  all due ,  he says ,  to the boom in advertising ephemera .  Production of matchbox grips by small businesses lasted for 42 years ,  from 1911 to 1953 .  They consist of a rectangle of thin metal , bent twice to grip three sides of a matchbox , and a printed <head>paper</head> cover crimped in a protective film of transparent celluloid . At least 645 different designs were published  the number in Mr Hooker 's  collection ,  shown for the first time last weekend at the British Matchbox Label and Booklet Society 's  annual exhibition in London .  Mr Hooker estimates that 12 years ago ,  when he paid 1.50 for his first grip ,  there were up to 100 collectors of whom he knew a couple of dozen .

Katharine Hamnett is a contradictory ,  impulsive figure :  a feminist who sells on sex ,  a vegetarian hedonist ,  a Labour voter with two sons at private school and a 20m turnover .  Some find her inconsistencies maddening ,  failing to understand how a right - on feminist could have done such a thing as using Mandy Smith in her show at the very height of the tabloid fuss over Smith 's  under - age relationship with Bill Wyman .  ( Though it certainly got Hamnett 's clothes in the <head>papers</head> ) . Katharine Hamnett 's  instinct for kicking against the Establishment comes partly out of the mind - set of her own particular generation ,  partly out of a reaction to an upper middle - class upbringing .  She was born Katharine Appleton in Gravesend in 1948 into a diplomatic family ,  and remembers herself as the girl on the reception line at dull diplomatic occasions in various European embassies while her father carried out his duties as an air attache .

1986 )  indicates a separating out of protestant and catholic ,  with the catholic population drifting westwards and vice versa .  The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist <head>parties</head> , Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party , though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism . Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties ,  a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new Ireland .  The Workers '  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .

Up to the late 1960s ,  catholic nationalists were split between two main political groupings .  There was the Nationalist Party ,  a weak organization for which local priests had to provide some kind of legitimation .  As a <head>party</head> , it really only exercised a modicum of power in relation to the Stormont administration . Then there were the republican parties who focused their attention on Westminster elections .  The disorganized nature of catholic  nationalist politics was only turned round with the emergence of the civil rights movement of 1968 and the subsequent forming of the SDLP in 1970 .

Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .  Also cosmopolitan in outlook are a variety of traditional professions ,  particularly university lecturers .  Many of these moved their allegiance to Ulster 's alliance <head>party</head> on its foundation in the mid - 1970s . The limitations on the power of these liberal groups within protestant loyalism are demonstrated by the fact that they have only been allowed to function among the leadership of the people so long as they obeyed the basic tenets and values common to the alliance as a whole .  This is shown in the protestant  loyalist rejection of Terence O'Neill and O'Neillism ,  and of his successors ,  Major Chichester - Clark and Brian Faulkner ,  as prime ministers of Northern Ireland  ( 196874 )  .

One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question .  Seamus Mallon ,  MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,  but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view .  Perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the <head>party</head> , John Hume , chooses his words over the future of the North . He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification ,  but talks of discovering a new way ,  setting up structures of co - operation in the North between the two Northern Communities ,  with the support of the Southern government .

In both cases ,  democracy is invoked .  But it is the theory of democracy as the right of the majority to rule which is seen as central ,  rather than democracy as the preservation of minority rights .  In the North , the belief comes via the British parliamentary tradition of the two - <head>party</head> system and its accompanying electoral process of first pass the post . For protestant loyalists ,  the majority means themselves .  In addition ,  protestant  loyalist politics has always been a zero - sum activity :  one either has a monopoly of power or concedes it to the opposition .

Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his <head>party</head> appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's  opposition to any bill of this kind ,  Dr Browne ,  himself secularly inclined ,  submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval ,  just as a previous Health Minister ,  Dr Walsh ,  had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .  If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course ,  how much more would have his religiously  devoted colleagues .

Loyalist <head>parties</head> refused to join in , and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional , nonviolent politics to participate . The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions

In early May ,  two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,  2 May 1986 )  .

I do wish everyone would stop writing me off just because I happen to be fifty .  It was n't until the final two weeks of term that it really hit me that I was actually going to have to go .  I remember the shock of realizing that this was my last ever second - year class , then my last ever third - year class , and then people started asking me about my leaving <head>party</head> . Why do n't you invite Paul Spence ?  Anne suggested .

So that you can leave with dignity .  I invited Paul Spence .   At the <head>party</head> , I was presented with a gold wristwatch in a cobalt - blue presentation case a wonderfully absurd gesture which nearly had me in tears . To my considerable surprise ,  nearly everyone decided to come .  In my mind ,  I had pictured Charles ,  Anne and myself standing in the middle of an otherwise empty common room ,  sherry glass in hand ,  desperately trying to think of something to say to each other.

The government would save so much money in the long run if they built us all homes instead of putting us up in this dump ;  it 's  ridiculous .

Though apparently  free ,  it needs its controller ;  but the controller must release it to the natural powers ,  the wind and the air - thermals ,  if he wants to enjoy its flights .

Working Paper 1 states that many core services are currently provided by hospitals likely to seek self - governing status ,  and the Secretary of State ,  in first establishing an NHS Hospital Trust ,  will approve the arrangements for providing core services .  Thereafter Trusts will be expected to continue to provide such services subject to review at the request of either <head>party</head> to the contract and , in the event of disagreement , the approval of the Secretary of State .

In this situation ,  the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental differences about the object of knowledge  ( despite overlapping of the actual material of study )  ?

It would represent a realignment within the humanities ,  not a diminution of them .

Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .  For as Mao decreed ,  if power grows from the barrel of a gun ,  it is the party that must control ,  and if necessary use ,  that gun .  Four months after the People 's Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of lives , few can have any doubt about the <head>party</head> 's determination to enforce this Maoist maxim .

Not as stirring as the protest movement 's  shouts of long live democracy ,  down with autocracy ,  they include cumbersome chants hailing the great achievement of socialism and warmly hail the victory over the turmoil and counter - revolutionary rebellion .

During Prince Sihanouk 's  rule ,  he and the Phnom Penh aristocracy would drive down to Kep for weekend parties and gambling in the casino .  By the early 1970s , the Khmer Rouge controlled the surrounding countryside , and the <head>parties</head> stopped . Since Pol Pot took power in 1975 ,  Kep has been deserted ,  and the villas stand windowless and empty .  The locals say the villas are haunted ,  but party officials from the provincial capital of Kampot ,  15 miles away ,  have no such fears .

The locals say the villas are haunted , but <head>party</head> officials from the provincial capital of Kampot , 15 miles away , have no such fears . In 1987 ,  when hopes of a political settlement in Cambodia were raised ,  the People 's  Committee ditched Marx and quickly moved into real estate ,  buying up all the villas in anticipation of a tourist boom .  Sok Hay ,  the 35 - year - old head of propaganda for the Kampot People 's  Committee ,  proudly showed the two - storey villa he had bought for 20,000 riels  ( 65 )  .

Comrade Springer ,  as his subordinates addressed him ,  was collecting views and opinions .  According to a recent Politburo dictum ,  the party will turn itself into a left - wing parliamentary party at its next congress early next year ,  and the Central Committee members were consulting local leaders about how to do it .  Mr Springer held a questionnaire , distributed to all <head>party</head> members . The group was analysing the results ,  which are to be discussed by a local central committee plenum today .  A motion has been put forward that the Polish United Workers Party  ( the Communist Party )  should give the right to vote to all of its members .

It was not clear whether he thought the name should be changed or not. The next meeting was in Opole Lubelski .  The local <head>party</head> secretary opened the meeting by welcoming the Lublin first secretary , and announcing the presence of a Western journalist . Comrade Rakowski  ( the party leader )  set the precedent for this by allowing some foreign journalists into the last meeting of the Central Committee ,  he explained nervously .  The Opole meeting was dominated by elderly party members ,  who refused to talk about such problems as names ,  new programmes ,  and new membership laws .

This new government ,  what is it doing ?  Is it realising the socialist ideals that we stood for ?  Before I joined the <head>party</head> 46 years ago , there was n't even a paved road from Lublin to Warsaw . Throughout the day ,  Mr Springer diligently took notes ,  nodding when members complained that the Communists had no economic programme to match Solidarity 's  ,  and when others questioned the acceptance of privatisation .  Later ,  Mr Springer said he had attended dozens of these meetings in recent weeks all over his district .

His attempts to link reductions in working hours to more flexible work practices ,  for example ,  have run into powerful union resistance .  The SPD 's  candidate for Chancellor seems to be narrowing to a choice between Mr Vogel and Mr Lafontaine ,  between a cautious compromiser and an erratic reformer .  The <head>party</head> is far from sure which message it wants to send to voters , and is likely to leave the choice until the last minute . Neither of these two men can control with any certainty ,  however ,  the factor that will perhaps exert the most influence on the SPD 's  election chances .  Whether the party likes it or not ,  its fortunes are hostage to the still youthful coalitions in Frankfurt and Berlin ,  and their notoriously unpredictable Green allies .

The white - bearded campaigner prided himself on blunt ,  outspoken views .

For us to promise the removal of nuclear power generation within 15 years would be to delude ourselves and mislead others .

KEN LIVINGSTONE was yesterday knocked off Labour 's  national executive in a vote which took the Brent East MP and his left - wing associates by surprise .  The likeliest explanation of his defeat in the executive 's  constituency section vote is that party activists wanted to rebuke him for publicly rocking the boat during the passage of the policy review .  Robin Cook , the <head>party</head> 's health spokesman , who retained his executive seat by coming second , said the vote showed the degree to which the party wanted to elect people who devoted their energies to helping Labour to win the next election . Ken Livingstone 's  problem is that he is always on the television slagging the party off .  It may also turn out Mr Livingstone lost because more constituencies this year balloted their full membership ,  rather than leaving it to their activist general committees to decide .

Before the debate , Gerald Kaufman , the <head>party</head> 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticised the resolution for its imprecision in not giving a time scale , and for ambiguity in not defining the precise level of spending required .

As Mao 's  personal secretary and speechwriter for over 30 years ,  Chen was one of the Great Helmsman  's  closest confidants ,  writing countless tracts and playing a key role in the Cultural Revolution ,  Mao 's  catastrophic campaign to purify the Communist party hierarchy and revive what he imagined to be China 's  fading revolutionary ardour in the 1960s .  Born in the coastal province of Fujian in 1904 ,  Chen began serving Mao in Yenan ,  the remote village in northwest China where the Red Army took refuge and regained its strength at the end of the Long March in 1937 .  While holding no important posts within the <head>party</head> and often dismissed as little more than a colourless clerk of little talent by Mao 's colleagues , he distinguished himself as a devoted and tireless servant both of Mao and his new wife Jiang Qing qualities that would later prove far more important than any formal title . After the Communist victory in 1949 ,  Chen followed Mao to Peking ,  where he worked quietly and largely anonymously for nearly a decade .  But ,  as Mao grew increasingly suspicious of and isolated from more distinguished revolutionary veterans ,  he turned increasingly to his secretary for help as he tried to rally support for more radical ,  leftist policies .

In 1966 ,  however ,  when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power ,  using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the party ,  Chen again rose to the occasion ,  acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's  increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies .  Chen is even said to have written ,  or at least supervised at Mao 's  behest ,  the Cultural Revolution 's  best - known tract  an hysterical call to arms against counter - revolutionaries printed in the People 's  Daily in April 1966 under the title Sweep away all ghosts and monsters .  To carry out a wholesale purge of the <head>party</head> apparatus , Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group , a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples , including Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy . The group was finally disbanded in 1969 ,  by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .  Again forced to moderate his ambitions ,  Mao called in the army to restore order .

The group was finally disbanded in 1969 ,  by which time China had been plunged into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .  Again forced to moderate his ambitions ,  Mao called in the army to restore order .  During his nearly three years as effective day - to - day leader of the Cultural Revolution , Chen , along with Jiang Qing and Mao 's security chief Kang Sheng , helped orchestrate campaigns of vilification and persecution against thousands of <head>party</head> cadres , including the then head of state Liu Shaoqi , who later died alone in a bank vault used as a cell . In a move for which he would later pay ,  he called for the persecution of Deng Xiaoping ,  who was banished from office and attacked as second only to Liu as China 's  leading capitalist roader .  Perhaps still smarting from his lowly position and lack of respect in Yenan 30 years before ,  he publicly condemned Deng as arrogant and dangerously ambitious :  To discuss with Deng Xiaoping as equals is more difficult than to put a ladder against heaven .

The significance of the defeat on Monday of Ken Livingstone ,  Brent East MP ,  could only be calculated for the first time yesterday when the detailed voting figures were published .  The left - wing former GLC leader said yesterday that left - wing opposition to the leadership remained strong .  But he accepted that his defeat revealed a general reluctance in the <head>party</head> to see that opposition voiced too vehemently in public . Mr Livingstone argued that the move towards unity was merely the normal pre - election loyalty which the party usually showed ;  the only difference this time was that it was happening 18 months earlier than normal .  But the Labour Co - ordinating Committee said that there was clear evidence of a cultural change .

The Labour Party Conference :  Kinnock hails party as fit for government :  We will keep on winning with no wheeling ,  no dealing ,  no horse - trading and no electoral pacts By JUDY JONES and STEPHEN GOODWIN NEIL KINNOCK yesterday hailed the Labour conference as a celebration of <head>party</head> unity and a demonstration to the electorate that the party was fit to govern Britain . In his keynote speech ,  the Labour leader said it was an inspiration to see the party working together in support of its policy objectives .  It is not an empty claim to say that this conference is one of progress ,  indeed one of celebration ,  not of relaxation or complacency .

The policy review had produced relevant and practical answers that offered the kind of socialism the British people understood and supported .  It was the kind of socialism that insisted the NHS was not split up or sold off ,  that resented the injustice of the poll tax ,  and opposed the centralisation ,  control and censorship which had eroded civil liberties over the last 10 years .  He predicted the Conservatives would hit back with personal attacks on Labour leaders , by ordering civil servants to waste time trying to cost the <head>party</head> 's programmes and then , next week at Blackpool , with the Team . At the back of the stage would be the new Tory slogan  The Right Team for the Future .  Margaret Thatcher 's  team  that 's  a bit of confusion in terms is n't it .

That is what we shall do .  Turning to the dramatic developments in East European countries ,  the Labour leader warned that the taste of freedom their people had been yearning for would turn sour unless they gained material advancement .  Those countries therefore have to make the leap from the command economy to the market economy , from the single <head>party</head> state to pluralism . It is essential therefore that the West ,  and especially the countries of the European Community ,  give their support .  The Labour Party Conference :  NEC compromise on black sections defeated

Ms Short said the women 's  vote could help Labour to win the next general election provided more women could be persuaded that Labour was sensitive to women 's  demands .  She said a majority of women had voted Tory since they got the right to vote ,  but a profound shift was now taking place .  An opinion survey by the <head>party</head> 's communications group showed women had significantly different political views from men . Women saw British society as too unequal ,  too competitive ,  too materialistic and too greedy .  Women wanted more equality ,  more social services ,  fewer weapons and less pollution .

The conference approved the Economic Equality policy review which proposes :  Ending tax on childcare ;  Introducing a minimum wage starting at half of average male earnings  ( 2.80 an hour )  ,  rising to two - thirds the average ;  Income tax levels of no higher than 50 per cent at the top ,  down to less than 20 per cent at the bottom ;  A significant and generous increase in child benefit over the lifetime of the Parliament ;  To tax gifts and inheritance at the point of receipt ;  To crack down on tax loopholes ;  Raise pensions immediately by 5 for single people and 8 for couples ;  To introduce a new disability benefit ;  To simplify income support rules ;  To keep mortgage interest tax relief at a single rate equivalent to the basic rate relief which we inherit .  Decisions The conference :  Called on the next Labour government to introduce retirement for both women and men at 60 on full pension ,  with the option of early retirement at 55 and to take emergency steps to restore cuts in young people 's  benefits .  Agreed a quota of 40 per cent for women 's representation on all <head>party</head> committees . Rejected the NEC plan for a separate society for black and Asian members that would be open to voting white members .

Surprisingly ,  this is true of both the classical and modern play ,  though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in ,  say ,  Shakespeare or Ben Jonson .  Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature so always try to look at them as plays for <head>performance</head> and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can . It 's  worthwhile reading some pre - Shakespearean drama ;  you could read Everyman  ,  a great morality play of the late Middle Ages ,  and Gammer Gurton 's  Needle  ,  first performed in 1566 and thought to be the second oldest English comedy .  You should try to read as much as you can of the great Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists ;  Shakespeare ,  Marlowe and Ben Jonson ,  Beaumont and Fletcher ,  Tourneur ,  Webster ,  Middleton .

Years of scholarship and so many contentious <head>performances</head> mean that the character is now regarded as difficult , when it can in fact benefit from the freshness and vitality of the natural actor , who will quickly find the comic qualities of the man as well as his serious side . Ophelia is often ignored for audition material simply because she does n't seem to have much in the way of a sustained speech until she goes mad .  Yet her earlier speech ,  where she describes Hamlet 's  condition and behaviour ,  has great tenderness and awareness :

Remember this when the pace hots up !  Students usually find that the first term 's  work is relatively gentle .  At nearly all schools no stage <head>performances</head> will be seen by an audience until at least the end of the second term . Sometimes students get anxious about this ,  and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ;  but if you think about it ,  the reasoning is clear .  Most of your technical tutors will be seeing everything you do ,  and deriving what they need to know from it ;  they do n't want to find you confused by criticism from senior students which might not be helpful to you at this point .

Students may find themselves performing in final productions over two full terms ,  which means they have the opportunity to play twice as many parts ,  but this depends on the school 's  policy and how they think you have progressed .  At this stage ,  too ,  the allocation of parts and the standard of performance is becoming a lot more competitive  a foretaste of the profession itself .  In many cases students will also tour in productions mounted by the school , and this gives good audience experience away from the greenhouse of school <head>performances</head> , where the people who sit in the audience are usually either professionally interested , or are fellow students and friends . Any programme of final drama school productions will present a variety of styles and the casting is aimed at giving students a chance to do well in suitable roles .  Naturally ,  with a cast of actors who are all approximately the same age ,  the casting of heavy character parts has to be considered very carefully ,  and of course not all plays are teeming with characters of similar age .

They are personal work - out sessions .  Altogether ,  tutorials take place over a period of about twenty - four weeks in the last year of a course ,  and usually by the last twelve tutorials a student has a much clearer idea of what he or she is about .  Where the tutorial focuses on current productions , I have found that students will work hard on their <head>performances</head> and be open about their work and any problems they may be having with the characters they are playing . A director may have made it plain that he has a definite intention for a character ,  but the student may not always see this straight away .  Discussing a character and finding an outline of what is required in a half hour tutorial can save a lot or time on a tight rehearsal schedule .

He concluded the bill was a legislator 's  attempt to assume institutions work on the kind of rational and ordered basis which they outwardly pretend .  In this he recognizes the same problem which faces the insider/ethnographer ,  for he clearly understands that pretence ,  deception ,  and bizarre social drama play a large part in police culture and accepts this will be difficult to research .  However , he is optimistic ( as any professional researcher must remain ! ) , for he cites Sir Kenneth Newman 's efforts as the new commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to make police ethics a major issue , so that <head>performance</head> assessment , promotion criteria etc. , will take integrity and professional conduct more and more into account . With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .

In effect we were becoming structurally and visibly undisciplined ,  in a world where discipline has its import spelled out  on every occasion .

Over the years I watched as senior officers struggled to come to terms with our bizarre presence ,  which overcame any respect they might have had for our practical mastery of dealing with a world they were wary of .  Of course ,  our bodily forms and somewhat disorganized working systems were in contradiction to their understanding of the correct codes of policing .

Klein ,  whose ages ranged from 40 to 60 ;  Leonard was just 23 .  )  In this film Leonard recorded eight poems from his recent book  ( For Wilf And His House ,  Beside The Shepherd ,  Poem ,  Lovers ,  The Sparrows ,  Warning ,  Les Vieux and Elegy )  ;  the sleeve was careful to emphasise that he also wrote songs for a local group called The Stormy Clovers ,  by no means his first such work .  And he was now frequently called to other public <head>performances</head> ; his first professional poetry recital was at Dunn 's Jazz Parlour in Montreal , where he recited Gift to piano accompaniment , in honour of the ancient traditions of poetry . Another event took place at Birdland ,  a jazz - club in the centre of Montreal ,  where Leonard gave poetry readings after midnight ,  frequently to the accompaniment of his own guitar on which he improvised appropriate backings ,  though often in company with more experienced jazz musicians .  His early involvement in this so - called jazz - poetry  which achieved such popularity in the sixties  shows that Leonard ,  not for the first time ,  and certainly not the last ,  was where it was all happening before it actually happened .

Before passing on I want to raise a problem with all this .  It may have occurred to some readers already .  Isn't there something suspicious about making the <head>performance</head> of intentional actions the acid test of objective knowledge when it is quite possible that young babies have a very rich knowledge about the unseen existence of objects but that they lack the capacity to co - ordinate this knowledge with their motor skills at object removal ? Constructivism seems to make this a logical impossibility ,  which of course means that no data could ever disprove the constructivist claims about what develops in  infancy :  any evidence that object knowledge  ( the object concept or object permanence )  exists without reaching behaviour will not be judged to be evidence for object permanence  as a point of logic .  I will say two things about this issue .

This is one of the reasons why Chomsky  ( 1959 )  was able to launch such a devastating attack on radical behaviourism .  The inadequacy of conceptualizing stimuli in purely physical terms is neatly illustrated in a study by Campbell ,  Landis and Regard  ( 1986 )  .  They compared the <head>performance</head> of two patients on a lip - reading task and on a task which required analysis of facial expression . One of the patients could not categorize the expression on faces that she was shown in photographs in terms of whether the expression was one of happiness ,  anger ,  surprise and so on .  However ,  she was  able to judge the sounds that were being mouthed by faces in photographs ,  and showed other evidence of normal lip - reading abilities .

When he is shown a pair of faces and has to decide which of the two is a celebrity ,  he performs at chance level ,  even though he performs almost as well as normal subjects on this task when the faces are replaced by their names .  In other situations ,  however ,  PH 's  pattern of responding makes it clear that he is recognizing familiar faces at an unconscious level .  The clearest example of this is PH 's <head>performance</head> in priming tasks ( Young , Hellawell and De Haan , 1988 ) . Associative priming is a well known phenomenon in cognitive psychology .  If one has to identify a stimulus  for instance a word  -  then one can accomplish this more quickly if presentation of the word is immediately preceded by an associated word or picture .

One theory is there should be Sydney ,  a week earlier than at present ,  leading into the Australian Open ,  the Stella Artois Championships as the traditional prelude to Wimbledon ,  plus Cincinnati and Indianapolis on the way into the U.S. Open .  Rather more controversial would be deciding which tournament should take pride of place in the European clay court season leading into Paris .  Tradition suggests Rome , especially now that it is once more a major tournament in every way , despite suffering from so many lack lustre <head>performances</head> from some of the leading players this year . Somehow ,  I cannot see either Monte Carlo or Hamburg allowing their status to be lowered without a fight .  Also in an ideal calendar ,  the Grand Slam Cup should be brought forward to the end of October ,  45 weeks after the US Open ,  which would not only give the players a brief chance to relax but then to prepare for the tour finale on an indoor surface .

While much was achieved in improving safety standards ,  towards the decade 's  end there was a series of accidents that perhaps shocked the public more than anything since Harrow  Wealdstone in the very early days of nationalisation .  And while the eighties saw fewer closures and many more reopenings than anyone could reasonably have hoped ,  it ended with thunder clouds of uncertainty about management style ,  privatisation ,  how to solve overcrowding ,  the Channel Tunnel .  Then there was the paradox that the erstwhile Premier Line out of Euston steadily slipped down the speed and <head>performance</head> league as the High Speed Trains out of King 's Cross , St Pancras and Paddington proved ( for all the undoubted technical troubles ) that they could sustain their role as InterCity 's workaday tool .

But it became clear that the passenger was not automatically right :  only when he paid up !

Sir Neville Cardus ,  another great music critic writing about the history of music ,  likened the image of great composers such as Bach ,  Mozart and Beethoven as ,  Looking at a range of mountains ,  those names are on the summits then one comes to a plateau  and there standing out and rising from it is the cathedral of Csar Franck .  This statement exactly sums up the quality and feeling of Franck 's  music .  As organist and piano teacher most of it was composed for <head>performance</head> at some ritual , often in church it conveys not only the solemnity of the occasion but also the spaciousness of the building and the sound of the organ with its vast range of tonalities . It is without emotion but conveys a sense of reverence for order and serenity .  Although Symphonic Variations  was not intended as a ritual ,  Ashton can be said to have used it as such for six dancers who were practising their art in the spacious simplicity of Sophie Fedorovitch 's  dcor .

Choreographers ,  like dancers ,  have long memories and what a student experiences in a class - room can trigger off an idea much later .  What develops may and usually does have some similarity to what was danced as a student .  Characteristic qualities of a step are likely to be retained because the type of music so decrees , although it will rarely be identical in its <head>performance</head> because it will have been refurbished . Types of Dancer Having chosen the story ,  theme or music ,  choreographers must consider the available living material through which they can mould the particular style of dance appropriate to their ideas .

Once the basic structure fur a story ballet has been created ,  the choreographer must find ways of linking the beginning ,  climax and end so that the plot develops easily from one scene to the next .  This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first <head>performance</head> of Giselle , certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear . These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and audience to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players .  Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .

Petipa 's  suggestion that beats can add brilliance to the dance is nowhere better exemplified than in the briss vois  and temps depoisson  of the Bluebird 's  solo in The  Sleeping Beauty  and other male solos from ballets by Bournonville .  But it is not so easy to find good examples of his suggestion that batterie  can lend wit except in the Blue Boy 's  rvoltades  in Ashton 's  Les Patineurs  .  But their witty <head>performance</head> depends on the soloist 's own attitude to the fun . Is he really to appear as if tripping himself up and thus about to fall ?  Or is he to show how difficult he finds them ?

Fokine 's  Harlequin only gives a glimpse of his abilities .  Ashton 's  Puck in The Dream  uses all his bag of tricks as envisaged by Shakespeare .  The whole <head>performance</head> is based on the classical vocabulary of steps shorn of every convention so that he can go swifter than an arrow from an archer 's bow . Every leap ,  turn ,  beat and somersault is perfectly co - ordinated with the phrase and with the music despite the fact that the dance scarcely reflects the period when the music was composed as does Ashton 's  choreography in other ballets  ( see page 42 )  .  Choreographers should therefore note that it is possible to design movements which may contradict the music that is being played ,  but not if they contradict the mood and rhythmic qualities of the whole context .

Details of the improved mosfet were revealed at a recent VLSI technology symposium in Japan .  The mosfet is less than 1m wide and operates at liquid nitrogen temperatures  (  - 196C )  .  Improved <head>performance</head> is obtained through building an ultra - thin channel of silicon - germanium alloy under the silicon surface of the mosfet to restrain mobility of the charges carrying current through the device . The germanium layer confines the charges just under the skin ,  preventing them from bumping into the surface and scattering from their designated path through the transistor .  Researchers built the channel so that it is free of dopants ,  stopping the charges from bumping into impurity atoms along the way .

Those on the input will be similar to what the standard Buck topology requires ;  those on the output ( s )  could be made smaller ,  though the reduction is limited by the need to keep enough capacitance  to absorb fast load transients .  To summarise ,  the Cuk converter has an apparent advantage over standard Buck topology in that it uses an integrated magnetic structure and can reduce input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  On the other hand , the required energy coupling capacitors cause problems and can be expensive at higher current levels , and there does not seem to be any proof that there is a volume , weight , or cost saving over the standard Buck topology for any given equivalent <head>performance</head> level . All credit is due to Terrence Finnegan for his two recent articles which ,  for the first time ,  have made available useful and usable designinformation .  Nevertheless the Cuk converter topology seems likely to remain an outsider until a true trade - off comparison can be made between Cuk and Buck at a series of realistic equivalent performance levels ,  a task that would take a lot of time ,  but whose results would be of great interest to many in the power supply design field .

Digital signal processing  ( DSP )  is generally regarded as one of the fastest expanding areas of electronics .

Continuing commitment and investment by IC manufactures in developing high <head>performance</head> DSP chips points to a very promising future for DSP . The four front runners with the highest market profiles are Texas Instruments  ( with its ever expanding TMS320 series )  ,  Motorola  ( DSP56000 and DSP96002 )  ,  Analog Devices  ( the versatile family of ADSP - 210x devices )  and ATT  ( the long standing DSP32C among others )  .

Most assemblers have facilities for creating macros and library functions and have the appropriate facility to allow parameter passing .  To accompany the cross assembler a linker will perform the usual task of allocating addresses to the assembled code modules and attaching the run - time libraries to generate an executable program .  When programming in assembler , the role of the simulator , copying operation of the DSP chip , can be quite invaluable especially if testing <head>performance</head> of numerical operations . Simulators have come a long way in recent years and today many of them use screen addressing to update the information .  An example is the Avocet Avsim321 TM32010 simulator  a good product as it gives instant visual access to all registers of the processor so users can monitor progress of the program ,  line by line if required .

In this case ,  the expansion card hosting the target processor comes to the fore .  Success of the PC as an engineering tool must in part be due to its expansion bus and the fact that nearly every type of facility can be found on a PC card .  Cards are by far the most effective means of investigating <head>performance</head> of a DSP device . But the user must be patient when learning the ins and outs of an expansion card .  Information in the user manual is almost always inadequate leaving new users to find out for themselves how it works  although this does enhance practical knowledge of the processor .

Arriving in Cyprus ahead of Othello ,  an understandably nervous Desdemona is forced to hang around on the quay and ,  in an effortful charade of lightheartedness ,  swap bawdy banter with Iago and company .  In Nunn 's  way of orchestrating the scene ,  however ,  the forced merriment comes across like the willed time - killing in Three Sisters ,  less the whiling away of a few specific minutes than the attempt to shake off a pervasive ennui .  Never less than thoroughly fascinating , the production is dominated by Ian McKellen 's extraordinary Iago , a <head>performance</head> which feels like a shifting palimpsest of impersonations . Partly ,  with his flat Northern vowels ,  tight blue uniform and fusspot bracings and flexings ,  he is the officious British bobby of the Derek Guyler school .  But in the discreet ,  epicene efficiency with which he clears away Casio 's  bowl of vomit or dusts down Othello after his fit ,  he is the finicky gentleman 's  gentleman ,  his body language strongly reminiscent of Dirk Bogarde in The Servant .

The nearest you get to this is the thrilling moment at the end of Act One when ,  as though he had engendered them ,  the thunder and lightning which usher in the next act and a complete change of country ,  melodramatically erupt during Iago 's  concluding lines .  Elsewhere ,  the close - up ,  detailed approach which works brilliantly ,  say ,  for Imogen Stubbs 's  affecting Desdemona  ( the pathos of her disoriented ,  jittery jauntiness intensified by beautiful touches such as the sepia photograph of her estranged father she keeps on the bedside table in Cyprus or the chocolates from Casio that she has secreted in a locked draw ,  not because she fears sexual misconstruction but because she would like to be thought too grown - up for frivolous sweet - guzzling by Othello )  paradoxically diminishes Iago because it encourages the belief that he can be realistically explained like a figure in a novel .  With Willard White 's massive , resonantly spoken ( if rhythmically uncertain ) Moor , the slight mismatch of scale between the size of <head>performance</head> and the chamber - dimension of the production is all to the good . Othello is larger - than - life and never more so than when determined to die ,  as White demonstrates in a nobly paced resumption of dignity in the difficult final scene .  But ,  with Iago ,  Nunn has opted for a congruence of scales .

If Les Negresses Vertes tend to jostle on the stage like animals being herded down a narrow street ,  it is partly because there are so many of them  ( 11 ,  when all the strays are rounded up )  ,  but also because ,  even as the show begins ,  several key members appear to be too drunk to be capable of motion in a straight line .  This might sound like irresponsibility , but , given how the <head>performance</head> pans out , you could also read it as professional commitment ; the longer the show goes on , the more the drink goes down and , in a remarkable contradiction of physics , the tighter the playing becomes .

It also comes naturally to them to include any musical form with a sharp sense of its own absurdity ;  ska ,  for instance  ( there are touches of Madness here )  or a hyperactive brand of rhythm and blues  ( they become almost a French Blues Brothers on Marcelle Ratafia )  .

Sessions 's  show endorses Petherbridge 's  point as forcefully as possible ,  reminding us that ,  in 20th century drama ,  the big stars have always been bigger than the big roles .  Mention Abe Lincoln and most of us visualise Raymond Massey .  True , he went to a lot of trouble to make his <head>performance</head> as authentic as possible ( 'he wo n't be satisfied till he 's assassinated , friends used to say ) , but in the end what we see is still Massey , not Lincoln . Telling the story of Napoleon through impressions of Marlon Brando ,  Phil Silvers ,  Diane Keaton ,  Gregory Peck and dozens more ,  Sessions simultaneously mocks and celebrates such overpowering casting :  Robespierre is no Henry Fonda .  He is Lee J Cobb through and through .

Modelling a succession of gasp - provoking Balmain outfits ,  Sian Phillips maintains a nice ,  self - amused poise as his wife .  But the play ,  because it wants its bread buttered on both sides ,  keeps its options open until the end on the issue of whether she is genuinely taken in by her husband 's  lie or whether her insistence that the girl stay the weekend ,  her broody concern for the future of the fictitious baby ,  and marriage - broking on behalf of Julie are just ways of stoking up Jacques 's  embarrassment .  To my mind , the excellent Ms Phillips would be able to give a much funnier <head>performance</head> if she were allowed to let us in on the truth from the outset . There are other incidental delights .  Sheila Steafel ,  in particular ,  turns in a sharp cameo as the girl 's  vulgar ,  port - tippling mother ,  a disaster area in fake leopard - skin and stacked heels ,  whose irruption into the proceedings powerfully increases the confusion .

Alas ,  Agnes Baltsa is hopelessly miscast in DG 's  new recording of Rossini 's  frothiest comic opera .  Her lack of authority is helped neither by a recorded balance that places her too far from the microphone throughout ,  nor by Claudio Abbado 's  propensity for extremes of tempo .  With this vital flaw , and with Ruggero Raimondi also failing to make much of an impact as the comically menacing Bey , the <head>performance</head> never gets off the ground . There is more to enjoy in Decca 's  Barber of Seville  particularly Cecilia Bartoli 's  fresh and delightful performance as Rosina .  However ,  William Matteuzzi 's  Almaviva is so weak that it requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to picture her preferring the young Count to the lecherous old Dr Bartolo ;  and although the late Giuseppe Patane conducts the score with obvious affection ,  he has little flare for dramatic pacing .

But she effortlessly avoided that exasperating coyness with which some seek to engage their audience ,  and the group also included the angelic Wir haben beide lange Zeit with whose chiming repetitions she wove an enchanting spell .  To frame this more familiar fare ,  she presented songs by Enesco and Marx ,  bringing to them the skill of a dramatic singer without ever overstepping the bounds of intimate communion required by the genre .  Enesco is a major force in twentieth century music whose almost total neglect at present is quite astonishing , and if his little Poemes de Clement Marot show a limited aspect of his art , they still breathed an engaging wit and charm in Miss Cotrubas 's heart - warming <head>performance</head> . No less devotion was brought to four songs by Joseph Marx ,  and although the rather overheated style of Nocturne elicited a few smiles  ( Parsons performing prodigies in representing the burgeoning June night )  there was a touching ecstasy in Hat dich die Liebe beruhrt which was delivered absolutely from the heart .  It could perhaps be said that Miss Cotrubas came truly into her own with the operatic excerpts that provided the second half of her programme .

As a star ,  Bette Davis was of the type commonly designated inimitable ,  which tends to mean  ( as it did in her case )  that she eventually became the butt of countless imitators ;  and these imitators merely accentuated symptoms of self - parody that were already detectable in her own screen presence .  Though she was a performer of indisputable talent ,  one was none the less left with a nagging impression that overarching each of her individual characteristics was another role ,  one she played to the hilt :  that of the grande dame ,  the First Lady of the American cinema ,  the Duse of the double - feature .  At her worst which is to say , when her <head>performances</head> , all crust and no bread , seemed little more than a rash of mannerisms she could strike one as impossibly tic - ridden and implausible . At her considerable best  when her physical angularity ,  her fluttery ,  melodramatic flounces and her inclination to treat the most unpretentious line of dialogue as a conversation - stopper were tempered either by a real affinity with the role in question or else by a witty ,  self - deprecating sense of her own absurdity in it  she remained one of the most consistently spell - binding of Hollywood stars .  Before the phrase became fashionable ,  Davis was ,  on - screen ,  the epitome of the castrating female ,  her appeal as a cinematic icon being thus largely confined to the feminine  ( and ,  by a probably logical extension ,  homosexual )  portion of her audience .

A final chapter is devoted to four case studies :  Michael Erhart of Ulm ,  Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg ,  Veit Stoss of Nuremberg ,  and Hans Leinberger of Landshut .  These short studies are in part historical ,  but partly art criticism ;  the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant ,  as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it .  The best preliminary <head>plan</head> may be for the reader to open the book upright at ( the illustration ) and then go to the other side of the room , to be imposed on from a distance : it is the nearest the book can offer to the proper first encounter with the figure . There is no one way of looking at a sculpture by Leinberger and similarly there is no one angle or distance from which we see it anything like whole ,  but there is something like a normal sequence of approach .  This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance ,  in this case as one walks into St Martin 's  at Landshut ,  more powerfully than other things in the field of view .

To do otherwise is to play into the hands of the facadists and myth - makers .  Our country has more than enough pubs whose ruined interiors fail to live up to the promise of attractive historic frontages .  A number of modern pub designers attempt to rescue a sense of intimacy and defensible space by dividing these open - <head>plan</head> arenas into token drinking areas . Yet a proper compartmentalisation of pub interiors means real choice for customers .  It enhances a pub 's  ability to cater for the different and sometimes conflicting activities and tastes of different customers under the same roof ,  and in so doing it keeps alive the healthy social and age mix that is a traditional hallmark of the true pub .

Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - <head>plan</head> which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls ,  chimney breasts ,  stairs and other internal features of interest ,  which is highly destructive of the building 's  historic character .  The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .

Given their prime location in the centre of towns and on major thoroughfares ,  Georgian coaching inns are frequently prime targets for refurbishment .  Such redevelopment is often unnecessary and detrimental ;  the end product of such schemes is all too often a sham - historical parody ,  re - creating an idealised ,  sanitised Britain that never actually existed .  In SAVE 's 1983 report Mike Pearce observed that many of the pubs in Winchester 's historic city centre have been modernised and remodernised to present the tourist with open - <head>plan</head> fast - food interiors modelled in the character of some mythical Merrie Englande . Nor do Georgian country pubs escape ,  either .  Many emerge from refurbishment with little of their original partitions ,  fittings or even masonry remaining .

I had ,  as I have said ,  hardly any money left ,  so with no new sources of income on the horizon ,  the sensible thing to do was to sleep rough .

Usually these situations arise from running out of height on the circuit ,  but they can also arise from arriving back far too high and by badly planned manoeuvring in an attempt to correct that kind of position .  Student pilots need plenty of practice at dealing with both these kinds of situation during their basic training if they are to learn to be able to spot them developing .  If they can do this , a change of <head>plan</head> at an early stage can usually prevent the situation from developing and leading to an accident . Very often during training ,  a student will be rather short of height but will just have sufficient for a normal approach .  The instructor may have been wondering if the height was going to be sufficient for a normal approach even though the student had already cut out the base leg to make a 180 turn on to finals .

All too often the pilot has a plan in his mind and sticks to it even when it should have become obvious that the situation has changed and his plan is no longer feasible .

However , if the pilot is thinking ahead , that option could have already been considered and he could have had the <head>plan</head> ready for use if more height was lost . Trying to do the normal thing can be the cause of accidents with cable breaks and winch failures on smaller gliding sites .  Sometimes the only safe thing to do is to land out of the site altogether in a nearby field .

The first indications of the new 1979 Conservative Government 's  attitude to investment became apparent when BR sought approval to build an  additional seven HST sets to cope with the first flush of growth following the launch of 125mph services on the East Coast main line the previous year .  After much haggling ,  approval was only obtained for those four out of the seven sets which could meet the much higher rate of return which would henceforth be applied to BR investment .  If BR could not make a case for seven trains for one of its most profitable routes , it was clear that <head>plans</head> for a second tranche of HSTs for the Cross Country group of services would not satisfy the new criteria . These were the circumstances which led BR to terminate HST building with a fleet of ninety - five operational trains .  It is a matter of history that as the 1980s drew to a close ,  a few extra HSTs to cope with the unprecedented levels of business by now on offer would have been very welcome .

At one stage the Birmingham New Street interchange was an integral part of the West Coast electrified service and was based on an hourly sequence of arrivals/departures from the LMR electrified area and to the North East via Sheffield .  As well as the series of long - distance trains which still run through Birmingham ,  the sub - sector now includes those few trains from the North West to Dover which run through Kensington Olympia in London ,  and the service between Manchester and Scotland via Preston and the West Coast main line .  In the late 1970s <head>plans</head> were prepared for a fleet of HSTs to operate the North East - South West ( Newcastle/Leeds - Cardiff/Plymouth ) route and these were introduced from 1982 . As already mentioned ,  many plans had to be  changed in the light of the recession and these included reduction of the number of Cross Country HSTs .  Plans to upgrade parts of Cross Country routes for higher speeds were also deferred .

The pace quickened ,  this year seeing the long - awaited introduction of the Thameslink service ,  the extension of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth and the delivery  ( albeit late )  of Class 442 Wessex Electrics units to give air - conditioned comfort to NSE passengers .  But 1988 ended with the disaster at Clapham discussed in the signalling chapter .  Given its success after only eighteen months , and the current <head>plans</head> to extend the Thameslink network , it now seems hard to believe that passengers have enjoyed the ability to cross London by regular electric BR services for such a short time . Success has been despite the somewhat confusing route plan initially imposed on the service south of the Thames by the necessity of incorporating the new service into an existing timetable without increasing mileage .  Thameslink was formally inaugurated by HRH The Princess Royal on 25 April ,  when she combined its formal launch with that of Save the Children Week and travelled with a number of children on unit 319036 to Crystal Palace .

The reason for this is that there are now two ways of getting your council 's  blessing to proceed with the work you have in mind .  The Full Plans method is the old system that has existed for many years ,  whereby detailed plans of your proposal are submitted in duplicate ,  along with an application form .  The <head>plans</head> are examined by the council for compliance with the Building Regulations , and if everything is in order you will receive an Approval Notice in due course , which you can then file away with your deeds . The Building Notice procedure is a comparatively new system and does not require the submission of any detailed plans .  With this method a simple form  ( Notice )  is deposited with your council ,  which gives brief details of the work you want to do .

Although no detailed plans are necessary ,  you will be required to provide a location plan showing the siting of your building ,  the boundaries of the site and particulars of any drainage works .  Once a Building Notice has been submitted and accepted by your council you can start work within 48 hours .  As there are no <head>plans</head> to examine , the council is not obliged to issue any formal letter of approval . Compliance with the Building Regulations is enforced by means of site inspections during the progress of the work .  A question which is often asked is ,  Are there any risks involved in using the quicker procedure of submitting a Building Notice rather than depositing full plans ?

A hardline motion calling for black sections is almost certain to be thrown out on Friday and the party could be left without a policy as support for a proposition calling for societies with exclusively black members is also in doubt .  Mr Kinnock 's  compromise would have created one society ,  with a national executive seat if it attracted more then 3,000 members .  The NEC adopted the <head>plan</head> by 21 votes to five . Bill Morris ,  deputy general secretary of the TGWU and the most influential black trade unionist ,  believes society membership should be restricted to representatives of ethnic minorities .  Mr Kinnock and his deputy ,  Roy Hattersley ,  have consistently opposed exclusively black sections .

The troubles of the nuclear industry in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 are well known :  a slowdown or halt to construction of new plants ,  plus the closedown earlier this year of the nuclear power station near Erevan in Armenia because of safety worries after last December 's  earthquake .  Now ,  in the space of four days ,  two key ministers have given bleak warnings over the state of affairs in both the oil and coal industries ,  the largest of their kind in the world .  In oil , the main problem is administrative disruption following last June 's merger of the oil and gas industries and the switch to greater financial autonomy for individual production units , coupled with intended massive cutbacks in capital investment <head>plans</head> as the government seeks to balance its own books . The situation is desperately serious ,  the Deputy Oil Minister ,  Vladimir Filanovsky - Zenkov ,  told the Socialist Industry newspaper last week .  The vast bulk of enterprises are not ready for change .

Christian deputies have been trying to obtain some form of timetable for a Syrian military withdrawal before accepting political reforms ,  but at their fifth meeting yesterday ,  the 62 MPs  half of them Christians  were persuaded to debate the future powers of a Christian Maronite president .  The Arab League 's  proposals call for cabinet veto power over presidential decisions ,  thus reducing Maronite control over the government and more accurately reflecting the strength of Lebanon 's  majority Muslim population .  Mr Sutherfield and his colleague , Richard Johns , presented to Mr Husseini a letter from 16 members of the US Congress who supported the league 's peace <head>plan</head> .

What this means is that Christian Maronite domination of the Lebanese body politic appears to be effectively at an end .

From DAVID USBORNE in Luxembourg FOREIGN ministers of the European Community lent enthusiastic support yesterday to a Commission plan to give Poland and Hungary food and financial aid worth 215m  ( 140m )  ,  together with loans worth up to 700m .

In its proposal for short - term action ,  the Commission suggests a five - point programme focussing on giving both countries huge amounts of food aid and concessionary loans to assist with reform ,  especially in the farm sector .

NEIL KINNOCK'S fragile compromise on black representation was rejected by the Labour conference yesterday ,  threatening to prolong the internal conflict with black activists through the run - up to the next general election .  The leadership proposals  for an ethnic minority - led socialist society open to white voting members ,  and a future national executive seat  crumbled under pressure from supporters and opponents of separate black sections at every level .  It left the Labour hierarchy acknowledging frankly that the long - running dispute had ended in stalemate , and with no clear <head>plan</head> for achieving a generally acceptable constitutional formula . Yesterday 's  debate was dominated by black sections supporters who derided the compromise notion of a mixed - race black and white minstrels society .  The outcome turned on the block votes of union delegations at opposite ends of the conflict ;  for and against establishing a separate body .

Mr Patten yesterday issued a draft housing planning policy guidance note ,  which will update previous documents .  The new policy will drop ,  for the first time since its introduction in the early Eighties ,  a presumption in favour of house - building at the expense of other conservation considerations .  It reiterates a growing theme in government thinking : that if the local authorities would only firmly write their own development <head>plans</head> as they are obliged to do , but which few have then environment ministers would feel obliged to honour them . Mr Ridley 's  mindedness to allow Foxley Wood depended on his view that it was a sounder way of ensuring Hampshire 's  share of new housing in the South - east than the county 's  own thinking ,  which assumed finding dozens of smaller sites .  The new decision does not let Hampshire off the hook  the county must still find room for 66,500 new homes  but it accedes to the county 's  own view that it can find the space more sensibly outside the north - east or central parts of the county .

By the 1920s a characteristic book ,  as for example Czanne :  a study of his development  by Roger Fry ,  published in 1927 ,  had black and white photographic illustrations only .

These descriptions were vital to writing about these two artists in whose work colour <head>plays</head> so important a part . At the end of the twentieth century ,  at least some colour illustrations are likely to find places in a monograph .  They may ,  however ,  not be exactly what the author would have preferred ,  as a colour plate which is readily available  ( perhaps having been used in another publication )  is much cheaper to use than a new plate which has to be commissioned .

America has had many unsuccessful attempts to form a national repertory theatre ,  performing the classics of the English language ,  and one wonders whether it will ever be possible to get this going effectively .  It 's  often thought that previous attempts have failed because there are n't enough well - trained classical actors in the USA to make such a repertory company feasible ,  but this is increasingly not the case :  American drama students are eager to train in the UK ,  and the percentage of successful auditions held is relatively high .  In Great Britain the ear becomes accustomed to the native British voice handling the classical text , but this really should not hinder American actors ; they need not become totally accentless in order to <head>play</head> classical verse . Instead they need to find out the rhythms of speech which make the music of the verse work in dramatic form .  Many American students working in British drama schools find the answer to this question by using what is called standard American ,  and this approach is being used now in training on both sides of the Atlantic .

The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,  and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .

Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare ,  but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII  ,  who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest .  If you do want to portray an older figure ,  it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's  Tale   she is a more fantastical character ,  without the added complications of historical authenticity ,  and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .

Discussing a character and finding an outline of what is required in a half hour tutorial can save a lot or time on a tight rehearsal schedule .

Perhaps certain parts played in the past have not succeeded ,  and it may be possible to investigate why .

So you played quite a bit in the classics during training .  J.F. I finished by <head>playing</head> Isabella in a production of Women Beware Women in a 1950 's style which may have helped when I came to my Ophelia , which was loosely based on a Princess Di concept . But I think my most rewarding part at drama school was Carol in David Storey 's  play Sisters  .  A.R.

J.F. I always wanted to do the heavy parts .  But I love <head>playing</head> comedy and then I 'm not very tall . Perhaps radio will allow me to play all the unsuitable roles that I ca n't do visually in the theatre ,  where it 's  just the voice and the character .  A.R.

But being trained to use your singing voice is really good .  Perhaps some of the voice teaching was repetitive in the second term ,  but when there was a change in voice tutor who developed pieces of your own choice rather than just vocal exercises the whole thing came alive and interesting .  I think that drama school stops you <head>playing</head> safe too early on in life and encourages you to take risks . I think if you do n't go to train and still find your way into the profession some of the essential things you need to know about and be able to do will take that much longer to achieve .

Yes ,  it did .  Although the story of my doing Balthazar B and the Beastly Beatitudes  is a bit strange inasmuch as I ended up playing the part that was completely opposite from the one I was originally intended to do .  That had more to do with management and the presentation of the play to those who were backing it so instead of playing Beefy , who is described as the world 's most beatific observer I <head>played</head> the opposite number who was the world 's last shy elegant young man.

It was not only a constitution which really was and is effective in the running of the state ,  but which was itself the product of the hegemonic culture already established .  Whyte  ( 1980 )  provides several instances of the influence of the Roman catholic moral code in both state decision - making and in public behaviour from 1922 through to the 1950s .  The most interesting one , in which clergy , local people , and the Dil all <head>played</head> their part , was the case of the protestant librarian in County Mayo , 19301 . A woman protestant was appointed as county librarian ,  but when the county library committee met to ratify the appointment ,  it refused to do so by ten votes to two .  The committee was largely made up of Roman catholic clergy ,  and they clearly opposed the appointment on the grounds that a protestant could not be trusted to safeguard the catholic morals of her charges in her purchase and loaning of books .

A very strong leading rogue character <head>played</head> with great guile by Clive Owen emerged out of a solid plot supported by the matchless acting skills of Leslie Phillips . The face pace of CHANCER was another leading ingredient moving the story along briskly in the best of popular drama traditions .  Having saved the sports car company and turned himself in at the end of series one ,  Clive Owen led off the second series in 1991 completing the last days of a prison sentence and abandoning the city slicker lifestyle for a battle to save a bankrupt stately home .

Eliot ,  though he knew The Waste Land  well .  )  In seeking to grasp this dynamic ,  and portray it ,  he had become enthused with the duende  ,  the spirit unleashed by the flamenco  music and dance  which he believed to be the dynamic of true art and artistic expression :  Repel the angel ,  kick out the muse ,  ,  he was wont to exclaim ;  arguing that artists must work from the gut ,  with the conviction and intensity that the expression exudes ;  allowing the life - force it releases to flow  torrentially ,  vividly ,  dramatically ;  as in the flamenco  itself .  It was precisely this spirit - this agitation against the staid and the genteel which Leonard had perceived in the guitar - <head>playing</head> of his late youthful instructor , whose demise had the intensity of surreal life . It was to hound and hasten Leonard 's  waking thoughts ,  eliminate any residual interest he may have possessed in mere intellectual commitment ,  and open to him the stark reality of life downtown .  from now on he was an enthusiastic convert ;  a propagandist ,  indeed .

It is thought that the Government may soon double this fine .

It might be thought that this was a natural consequence of the popularity of great artists ,  but in fact the economics of publishing result in some bizarre decisions about art books .

One way for a publisher to finance the publication of an art book is to act with other publishers who will share costs ;  an alternative is to find a subsidy .

An exception may be illustrated by a passage from a classic biography ,  that of John Constable by Charles Leslie .  Leslie was himself a painter ,  and thus comments in his own right on his friend 's  art ,  as here on a painting of Hampstead Heath :  I have before noticed that what are commonly called warm colours are not necessary to <head>produce</head> the impression of warmth in landscape ; and this picture affords , to me , the strongest possible proof of the truth of this . The sky is of the blue of an English summer day ,  with large ,  but not threatening ,  clouds of a silvery whiteness .  The distance is of a deep blue ,  and the near trees and grass of the freshest green ;  for Constable could never consent to parch up the verdure of nature to obtain warmth .

In seeing African sculpture reproduced ,  the reader can remember that this art is to an extent being misrepresented by photography .  Secondly ,  the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,  even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of difficulty arises in descriptions of works <head>produced</head> in far Eastern cultures . While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking ,  as it were ,  through an image to what it represents or means ,  an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing ,  in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work .  Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing .

What changed with the partition of Ireland in 1920 was that the two dominant alliances were internally reorganized .  In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry .  The two alliances were ascribed territories in which to <head>produce</head> their social structures , political institutions , coercive bodies , informal and interpersonal networks of maintaining influence , and more clearly defined hegemonic cultures . The two societies gave expression to their own dominant interests as far as possible unhindered by each other 's  interference .  The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .

During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which ,  though often of architectural and historic interest in their own right ,  do not fit in with the designer 's  concept of the pub 's  ideal form .  Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced , ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen , other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to <head>produce</head> rustic charm . At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .

Greenhill  ( 1981 )  ,  then a lecturer at the college ,  discussed this history of police/sociology antagonism in detail ,  arguing a tendency in each side to discredit the other ;  resulting in a situation where the number of published British texts and research studies on the sociology of the police may be numbered on the fingers of both hands .  I suspect Greenhill was referring specifically to a dearth in the cultural analysis of policing ,  while his use of the duality of sides reveals another parallel binary to that of cops and robbers ,  with the police and sociology arraigned against each other in yet another of the wars which the police wage against those who defile the sanctity of their definition of the concept of order .  Constant separations between the two categories are promoted , <head>producing</head> a dichotomized vision of left - wing , radical reformists , antagonistic to the right - minded boys in blue and includes a wealth of negative imagery of sociology which is lodged deep in the collective consciousness of the police mind . The sociologist ,  as I shall illustrate ,  is the despised ,  hairy ,  intellectual subversive ,  who is set against the clean and ordered British bobby .  To reinforce a belief in their own omnipotence and popularity ,  the police have made increasing use of market research to show they are well liked ;  especially by that important category the silent majority .

Quite often the divisional boundaries in the amalgamated force mirror the old ,  small force boundaries and men define themselves  in relation to their early experience with perhaps an inner city ethic ,  a large - town police style ,  or in the framework of a more rural situation .  In each case they inevitably begin to denigrate their opposite numbers for not doing real police work .  Tribalism in the pre - amalgamated forces <head>produced</head> a very constricted vision of the world , so that spatial concepts and a narrow geographical containment held a paramount place in determining police reality . Today these are still of immense import ,  with men deriding those in another division or section ,  bragging that their villains are the toughest or their section tasks more numerous and arduous .  An expressed desire for rigidly determined geographical units separated from a despised neighbour occurs again and again in my fieldnotes ,  and is clearly illustrated in a note made in 1981 ,  when a superintendent in a somewhat remote subdivision laughingly told me :

This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse  ( chaired by Baroness Wooton )  on the use of cannabis ,  I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm ,  simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value  medical debilitation .  Such awareness provided another means for the obsessive anxieties of the establishment to be counterbalanced from within ,  and as Jacobi  ( 1967 :  22 )  suggests ,  created the potential ability to look truths in the eye and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible .  This , however , <head>produces</head> a further paradox , for this reflexive style , welding the practical mastery and special knowledge of the subjective insider to an objective interpretation of events is not one the institution of policing is geared up to handle .

The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no difference between the number of realist answers <head>produced</head> by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .

Muscles are made up of fibres which have different mechanical properties ,  and two of the main groups of fibres are called fast twitch fibres and slow twitch fibres .  The fast twitch fibres have a much higher contraction speed and are associated with dynamic bursts of energy .  The slow twitch fibres react much more slowly and are more resistant to fatigue , <head>producing</head> greater endurance . Thus it is clear that you need to work on the fast twitch muscles if you want to improve your speed .  The ratio of fast twitch to slow twitch fibres varies between individuals and is determined by heredity .

Use of line Designs composed of small masses of veneer forming a readable picture ,  correspond roughly in looks ,  if not in colour ,  to subjects as they actually appear to the eye ;  they seem to be in 3D even though they are flat ,  and to a degree they are naturalistic .  There is another branch of graphics , however , in which an image is <head>produced</head> by the use of line rather than mass . In its most basic form the technique involves merely an outline ,  or when it is filled in ,  a silhouette ;  but of course it can be much more elaborate than that .  Linear representation of solid form has always been a valid artistic technique ,  especially in drawing  ( as distinct from painting )  ,  and it can be used in marquetry work also provided the nature of the material  ( ie .  wood )  is not ignored .

As a design project it is perhaps the most exploited .  But when one considers the requirements of such a piece of furniture ,  they are really quite simple :  it must be robust ,  comfortable and elegant .  Whereas it is simple to make a robust chair , combining these three characteristics and yet <head>producing</head> a chair which has individual character can be a real challenge . I would imagine that most chairs made by craftsmen are of the spindled variety ,  from the Windsor to the Shaker and many shades in between .  Although no one will doubt their possibilities for elegance and robustness ,  sitting on a solid wood seat can test the limits of comfort after quite a short time and woven seats are little better .

However ,  to satisfy the requirements of comfort ,  the back should curve  ( in the horizontal plane )  to accommodate the back of the rib cage ,  and there should be no large obstruction to the positioning of the backbone .  These two points provide objections to the ladderback design ;  with sitters of different heights ,  the cross bars can hit prominent vertebrae .  The thought of <head>producing</head> many curved back pieces is a bit off - putting . With the stickback style ,  however ,  it is only necessary to curve the top piece ;  the sticks would then position themselves into a curve ,  even from a straight base .  This base can be the rear seat rail ,  or another rail fitted above the seat ,  but if so ,  no more than 2in above the seat or it would also need to be curved to avoid discomfort .

Improving ratios might have satisfied officials at headquarters but have only <head>produced</head> harder work and often more complaints from the public for the railwayman out on the system . To a large extent this is perhaps inevitably a criticism of the chairman from September 1983 ,  Robert Reid .

An important feature of the 1980s which has contributed to InterCity 's  financial turnround is market segmentation and pricing  or the shaping of products to meet the needs of customer groupings .  Essentially this concept is not new  from the early days our railways were providing first -  ,  secondand even third - class accommodation and the excursion ticket was quickly used to sell spare capacity .  What is new is the much greater degree of sophistication which is now necessary to <head>produce</head> the maximum revenue yield from each and every InterCity journey . Today 's  equipment  trains and track  is very expensive to provide and maintain ;  to cover its basic costs it has to be in service providing revenue for up to say sixteen hours per day .

Authority was obtained for the modernisation of the Chiltern line between Marylebone and Banbury via Bicester including resignalling and the provision of seventy - seven Class 165 Networker coaches ,  and in August the then new Minister of Transport ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  authorised the first hundred Networker four - car trains for the North Kent lines .  The decade could hardly have ended on a more optimistic note .  While it has to be obvious that current success has been built on foundations that were perhaps sounder than people generally thought ten years ago , the combination of a livelier economy and greater commercial drive ( leading above all to more commonsense , usually more local management ) has <head>produced</head> results far above the most rosy forecasts . The pride taken not only by many staff but passengers in their more clearly identified Lines is paying handsome dividends .  But four main factors are singled out by Chris Green for the currently greatly improved outlook :  the record investment currently being made ,  at the end of 1989 amounting to an astonishing million pounds a day ;  the success of the Networker train whose carriages in 1989 were being delivered at the rate of one a day ;  the enormous level of London station development both enhancing the environment  ( who at the start of the 1980s would have thought of treating a terminus as a shopping precinct ?  )  and producing revenue on the grand scale ;  and the steady introduction of Integrated Electronic Control Centres  ( discussed in detail in the signalling chapter )  .

( The asbestos had been built into the carriages to act as sound and heat insulation ,  but had of course later been found to be a health hazard .  )  The same work was also required in a large number of the early Mark 2 locomotive - hauled carriages ,  and in many long - life electric multiple units .  It emerged that across the very varied fleets the cost of asbestos removal would be 25,000 per vehicle , an investment <head>producing</head> no financial return . The question had to be asked :  could the purchase of new trains produce savings sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their capital costs as well as reducing the burden on the PSO ?

Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .

By the late 1970s CAMRA ,  now known as the Campaign for Real Ale ,  had more than 28,000 members .  Its presence had at first been derided by the national brewers but its campaigning zeal attracted continual media attention and many independent brewers had been encouraged to return to cask beer production with enthusiasm .  By the time CAMRA celebrated its first ten years it could pride itself on a large national membership and a series of hardhitting reports that had exposed the market domination of the big brewers and the shoddy beers they <head>produced</head> . The drinking public was now aware they were being taken for a ride by the brewing barons .

British lagers are rarely stored  ( from the German word lagered )  for the period needed to develop taste .

The brewers of these beers want to <head>produce</head> them as fast as possible and use chemical additives to speed up fermentation , cut down on yeast head to get more liquid into the fermenters and to produce a beer with a thick head of foam . These beers are also made with substantial levels of adjuncts to the malt mash :  maize ,  rice ,  triticale ,  wheat flour and potato starch .  British brewers do not have to declare the ingredients they use but when American consumers ran a check of Miller Lite they found it contained corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .

Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to <head>produce</head> bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be added towards the end of the boil or even afterwards .

Copper hop ,  late hop and dry hop extracts are available ,  each emphasising the flavour associated with that particular procedure .

Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being added from whole hops or ,  more likely ,  from a dirty hand .

The co - operative sells more cone and pellet hops than any other form .  But 20 per cent of its hops are now in the form of oils and essences and it is a growing sector .

And David Gardner 's  defence of processed hops does remind the listener powerfully of the arguments advanced by the brewers in the 1960s when they were replacing cask ale with keg beer .

During the periods when the core is not saturated ,  the inductance of the coil causes the current passing through it to change linearly from one saturation state to the other. As the core reaches saturation the inductance falls to a low value and the current rises rapidly to a limit set by the DC resistance of the coil forcing the core well into saturation .  The waveform of this current is shown in Fig. 2 which also serves as an illustration of the magnetic field <head>produced</head> by the coil , since this must be directly proportional to the current . The induction in the core is magnified by the high permeability ,  except in the saturation regions where the result can be seen to be a trapezoidal induction waveform  ( Fig. 3 )  .  The voltage induced in the pickup coil by this waveform is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic induction .

The voltage induced in the pickup coil by this waveform is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic induction .  During the periods of saturation ,  there is no change and no signal voltage ,  but during the linearly changing regions there is a constant voltage output of appropriate polarity ,  as shown in Fig. 4 .  All of the above assumes that the only influence on the core is the magnetic field <head>produced</head> by the excitation coil . If this is not the case and the core is affected by an additional external field ,  a small change takes place in the output .  The component of external  field which is in line with the core axis either aids or opposes the excitation field in its alternating polarity phases .

Complementary outputs from the lower frequency bistable are used to operate voltage switches which connect the full supply voltage across the excitation coil in alternate directions thus providing the square voltage waveform .  A small resistor is connected in series with the coil to limit the current during core saturation .  The frequency is chosen to make sure that the core reaches saturation at each alteration , but does not spend any more than a short time in this condition so as to maximise the final output signal ; the circuit should <head>produce</head> as many saturation signals as possible . The pickup coil signals connect to analogue switches controlled by the first  ( and higher frequency )  bistable in the driving divider chain ,  in order to isolate only those signals which coincide with the saturation waveform transitions .  The signals from the two switches are fed to two operational amplifiers configured as simple RC low - pass filter/integrators .

This is not as difficult to do as it sounds ,  simply because of the very broad maxima and minima .  If the intention is to make serious measurements calibration with a Helmholtz coil will be required .  The outlined design <head>produces</head> a field of 3.95 gauss/ampere . Strictly this implies a precision greater than is reasonable and should probably be read as 4.0 gauss/ampere or 400 gamma/mA  ( one gauss = 100 000 gamma )  .  The sensitivity sought at the test point is 20 000 gamma/volt :  + 2.5V corresponds to a range of 100,000 gamma so the initial Helmholtz coil current setting should cover this .

This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and produce the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly .  Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's  upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .  These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and <head>produce</head> ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles . This explains why so few protons are detectible at the earth 's  surface except after very major events .  The increased ionisation along the earth 's  lines of magnetic force make them more conductive and leads to an increased current flow with consequent rise in magnetic flux levels .

Therefore ,  extra headroom has to be provided for the operating flux .  As a result another apparent advantage often cited for the Cuk converter  ( that it can use the full peak - to - peak bidirectional flux swing )  is ,  in practice ,  whittled away .  As for the claim that the Cuk converter approaches 90 % efficiency and <head>produces</head> minimal RF interference , exactly the same claims can be made for well - designed standard topologies . Good efficiency is mainly a matter of using good switches and rectifiers ,  since they are where most of the losses occur .  The low RF interference and low component count claims are usually made because the Cuk topology is not only able to accommodate the input and output filter chokes on the same magnetic core as the transformer ,  but it can also reduce the input and output ripple currents to very low levels .

Fig. 1 illustrates that by linking such splines at a common point and opposite tangent directions ,  an indefinite length of smooth curve can be defined with relatively little data .

As powerful as drawing description files can be ,  they would get a bit unworkable if faced with ,  say ,  a colour photograph of a budgerigar .

It takes imagination and a lot of practice to read a play to yourself in the same time as it would take to see it on the stage .  Surprisingly ,  this is true of both the classical and modern play ,  though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in ,  say ,  Shakespeare or Ben Jonson .  Here is a suggested first reading list , which I 've put together to <head>provide</head> a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's development .

As Gibbon has noted ,  the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .  By <head>providing</head> core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

For centuries the Roman catholic church and faith were the bread of life to the subordinate classes in Ireland ,  deprived of their land ,  civil rights ,  and education .  The church not only provided solace and comfort in those long years ,  but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression .  It <head>provided</head> intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation . The clergy were the only source of education apart from the hedge school teachers  ( Dowling 1968 )  and provided a significant moral and organizational resource .  Several aspects of catholicism became particularly important in the nineteenth century .

An indicator of the growing importance of this totalizing view of education was contained in the 1841 rescript from Rome .  It announced that ,  if doctrine as opposed to Bible stories was to be a part of school education ,  then such religious education could not adopt a common denominator approach between the churches ,  but had to be total in its presentation of what the Roman catholic church considered to be the truth ,  otherwise such an approach would be dangerous for the children  ( Gaine 1968 :  164 )  .  The implementation of this policy was the work in part of the new Roman episcopal appointees , from Cullen onwards , though the growing hatred of the ascendancy because of the famine and their continued landownership must have <head>provided</head> ample cause for separate schools for the majority of Roman catholic clergy . Already in the 1850s ,  Roman catholic bishops attacked the setting up of the model schools ,  intended for the pursuit of educational experiments within a multi - denominational setting .  In 1860 ,  the rules on the composition of the National Education Board was changed to permit equal protestant and catholic representation .

The present interrelationship between control of the schools and the two alliances varies in each part of Ireland ,  though one should also bear in mind the additional underpinning of the alliances both North and South by one of the traditional values of bourgeois capitalism ,  private and selective schooling .  Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland , the catholic schools ' sector is <head>provided</head> for out of state funds , and remains under the governorship of the local clergy , now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards . Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's  determination not to lose control of them .  The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .

The consequence of having such large schools with small protestant catchment areas was that those funded from the state had to make up numbers by accepting non - protestants .  The Roman catholic element in all the republic 's  protestant second - level schools varies from one school with 0 per cent to one school with 40 per cent of the total .  But some of the headmasters have a deliberate multi - denominational policy in terms of ethos and curriculum and the schools do <head>provide</head> multi - denominational settings which , if researched , could throw light on debates about denominational and shared schools . The current expansion and urban growth in the Southern population has also affected the protestant community ,  and the increased pressure on schools in urban areas ,  such as Dublin ,  is likely to lead to a diminution of the protestant - catholic character of most protestant schools ,  unless deliberate decisions are taken to preserve the balance .  What emerges from this brief overview is the dominant role of the clergy in Southern education .

The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still <head>provide</head> a pleasant , varied atmosphere . However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .

Directional stability In flight In flight , the directional or weathercock stability is maintained by the fin and rudder , which <head>provide</head> extra side area behind the c.g . Thus with the aileron and rudder held in a central position ,  a glider will always weathercock into line with the relative airflow ,  just as the wind vane on a church steeple will always swing into the wind .  When rudder is applied ,  the nose of the glider yaws to the side until the force produced by the rudder is balanced by the tendency for the aircraft to swing back into line with the airflow .

Unless the winch or car is very under - powered ,  pulling up steeper on a fast launch has little or no effect on launching speed .  All the pilot can do is to signal if the launch is too fast or abandon the launch if it is to slow .  The other system requires a device to measure the load in the cable or to control the maximum pull that the vehicle will <head>provide</head> . In this system the speed is largely controlled by the glider pilot .  If the launch is too fast the pilot simply pulls up into a steeper climb .

Unexpected stalls Most unintentional stalls occur ,  by definition ,  unexpectedly and usually the first obvious sign of what has happened is that the pilot is banging the stick on the rear stop with the nose still dropping  a frightening feeling .  However , <head>provided</head> that a movement forwards is made to unstall , the possibility of a full spin will have been avoided . The order of movements is relatively unimportant compared to the necessity of making an immediate forward movement to reduce the angle of attack of the wing so that it unstalls .  If you imagine suddenly and unexpectedly finding yourself in an almost vertical dive facing the ground ,  it is easy to understand why so many pilots fail to make a movement forward on the stick to help the glider unstall itself .

Many incidents and accidents are caused by lack of experience and the pilot unwittingly putting himself into situations beyond his capabilities .  For example ,  it is important for an inexperienced solo pilot to avoid a field landing until he has had some training in how to tackle one .  Hundreds of landings on one particular airfield or gliding site do not <head>provide</head> good training for landing in fields . Unfortunately ,  being familiar with an approach takes away much of the need for real judgement .  Pilots ,  and even instructors ,  often believe that they have good judgement and can land accurately anywhere because they can manage on their own site .

Pilots should be encouraged to make an assessment during the final turn of how much airbrake they will need as they start to straighten up for the final approach ,  instead of waiting until the turn is completed at which point it is already too late .  The use of the airbrakes during the final turn should be discussed and pilots should be encouraged to try it if they are too high .  It should be emphasised that there is no reason to discourage any but the most inexperienced solo pilots from opening the airbrakes in the final turn , <head>provided</head> the glider is not already low ( or slow ) . Inability to sideslip effectively with full airbrake on the final approach Sideslipping takes skill and practice .

This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,  but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .  Try some very steep turns and then some with about 40 of bank ;  try reversing the turn quickly ,  and making little centring moves .  Of course , if there are thermals about , do all this in the lift , <head>provided</head> there are no other gliders sharing your thermal ! You should be able to go into turns and make centring movements without having to refer to the slip ball ,  yaw string ,  or ASI .  Different types of glider behave slightly differently ,  so explore all the gliders you fly and adapt your flying accordingly .

At times it is even possible to lay out for examination the intense post - liminal rites and ceremonies of reincorporation required by the police institution as it seeks to draw the marginal mover back into the fold .  Usually ,  however ,  the social move is merely in the form of a transfer within well - developed sections of police society where the new experience is structured by the same ideology and beliefs which have gone before .  Occasionally , however , the insider is moved across a new boundary severe enough to create a rite of separation and <head>provide</head> the scope for an introspective analysis to generate something akin to a new vision . In this situation ,  the marginal mover acquires the power to reinterpret the way his institutional structure governs a desire for a rigidified world of immobility ,  and to understand why ,  for example ,  those few policemen who move into other areas ,  such as probation work or the legal profession ,  become totally suspect .  Transition to the outside destroys the manufactured reality of one real world and two ex - police probation officers I knew became  the equivalent of potential prigs .

Furthermore ,  the reading I did for the lectures I was called to give as a drugs expert generated queries about such ambiguous areas as victimless crimes and interference in private acts ,  and altogether raised more questions than were solved .  This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse  ( chaired by Baroness Wooton )  on the use of cannabis ,  I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm ,  simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value  medical debilitation .  Such awareness <head>provided</head> another means for the obsessive anxieties of the establishment to be counterbalanced from within , and as Jacobi ( 1967 : 22 ) suggests , created the potential ability to look truths in the eye and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible . This ,  however ,  produces a further paradox ,  for this reflexive style ,  welding the practical mastery and special knowledge of the subjective insider to an objective interpretation of events is not one the institution of policing is  geared up to handle .  We were now floating between a world of the street - wise ,  the gentle hippie ,  the communal crash pad ,  the lecture hall ,  the courts ,  the addiction unit or hospital casualty department ,  and the front page .

This is not to say that folk psychology already has adequate theories of perception ,  language ,  memory or any other cognitive process .  Indeed ,  the data from patients with brain injury that I will be discussing in the final two sections are very puzzling indeed from the standpoint of folk psychology .  The point is simply that the account of mental processes which folk psychology <head>provides</head> , constitutes an explanation at an appropriate level of abstraction for the purposes of explaining behaviour scientifically . It should be emphasized that this level of explanation does not commit the functionalist to a belief in any non - physical substances or processes .  Most ,  perhaps all ,  functionalists are thorough - going materialists who believe that mental phenomena are genuine physical  phenomena seen at a particular level of abstraction .

If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content  ( and see Dennett ,  1988 ,  for some powerful arguments that it is not )  ,  then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .  Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not <head>provided</head> any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it . What I now want to suggest is that there is a lot of very successful science currently being conducted which literally depends on functionalism being true .  If functionalism is false ,  then the success of the cognitive sciences is a massive scientific fluke .

This means that they are able to retrieve the appropriate pronunciation of a word as a whole from the speech output lexicon .

I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another sort of input between these two which would <head>provide</head> the ultimate bits of information to which rules are applied ( p. 199 ) . My favourite phenomenological quote ,  however ,  comes from Jennings  ( 1986 )  :  social psychologists spent years conducting experiments to specify the exact parameters of a hypothetical motivational state called cognitive dissonance

Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of  schedule ,  which means agents are asked to see students '  work over a fairly compressed period .  Agents are notified of performances by the schools , and they also <head>receive</head> hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances . Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .  It will be the same story for many moons to come .

However ,  it suggested that the October holiday should replace an existing holiday .  Angus Crichton - Miller ,  managing director of the Rank Organisation 's  holidays and hotels division and a member of the study group said :  It is not an efficient system to have such changes between busy and quiet periods and it would be better if we could flatten prices over a longer season ,  rather than have such high - peak - season prices .  The October bank holiday proposal has <head>received</head> a muted response from Employment Minister Michael Howard , who said he was open to persuasion but had no plans to make changes . As well as suggesting an autumn boost for the tourism industry ,  the group also proposed changes at the beginning of the season by introducing a fixed - date Easter holiday .  By creating a more definite starting and finishing point to the season ,  members of the group believed that the growing trend of out - of - season holidays and short breaks could be accelerated .

Railborne steel traffic suffered in proportion to the cutbacks in the steel industry itself ,  with complete withdrawal from one or two locations such as Consett in County Durham .  Interestingly ,  though ,  Railfreight also derived some benefit from the contraction of British Steel 's  steel - making activities .  The concentration of blast furnaces at a smaller number of plants meant that the rolling mills at Corby and Shotton , for example , would henceforth <head>receive</head> their raw steel from other parts of the country . This provided Railfreight with valuable contracts for long - distance bulk coil traffic ,  traffic which would not have materialised if the steel industry had survived the 1980s unscathed .

The increase was even felt to be too great :  in 1964 ,  when British groups reached 212 ,  it was decided to slow down the growth in the UK  not to act upon the ephemeral  enthusiasms of an odd individual ,  but to go for quality .

Modern art historians strive to analyze ,  interpret ,  and evaluate works of art by identifying their materials and techniques ,  makers ,  time and place of creation ,  and meaning or function .  They inquire about the who ,  what ,  when ,  where ,  and why of the art object ;  often the object itself suggests which of these questions should be pursued .  But the function of art history today is not only to make such identifications , but also to relate an individual work humanistically to other works of the same school , period and culture , while <head>remaining</head> sensitive to its salient aesthetic qualities . According to this American guide ,  Art criticism is a many - levelled activity that comprises the historical ,  the recreative ,  and the judicial .  In all cases it seeks to pronounce value judgements ,  an exercise shunned by art history .

One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic  nationalist population as a whole ,  though one in which certain groups ,  namely farming interests and the church ,  at both clerical and popular levels ,  have strategically dominated ,  at least until recently .  By 1914 ,  the protestant  loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary .  Issues of class conflict within the group were to <head>remain</head> largely subordinate , as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day . There was to be an expression of a certain solidarity between members of both the catholic and protestant working classes in the Belfast demonstration of 1932 against the inadequate poor relief during the period of particularly high unemployment .  But such cooperation was rare and quickly taken over by sectarian issues .

This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .  But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland , as nationalist parties described it in their New Ireland Forum ( 1983 4 : i . 28 ) , from <head>remaining</head> basic to the perceptions of both parties .

Local folk religion still continues in some forms .  Its resistance is exemplified by the recent moving statues devotional upsurge of 1985 in South - West Ireland ,  where statues of Mary were believed to have changed their posture ,  wept ,  and bled  ( Tobin 1985 )  .  National centres of devotion <head>remain</head> relatively strong the shrine to Mary at Knock , the annual climbing of Croagh Patrick , pilgrimage and penance at Lough Derg . In fact ,  whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people ,  and the issue tended to be decisive ,  catholic spirituality diverged on both points .  The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite ,  where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life .

Sodalities ,  such as the Legion of Mary ,  Opus Dei ,  and Christian Life communities ,  have partially extended this form of commitment to some ,  particularly more middle - class laity ,  and continue to have an important role in activating laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially .  But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics <head>remain</head> the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always added to the clergy 's  spiritual authority and status ,  and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals ,  with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals .  The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

It is important to point out that these expressions which interpret Irish social reality and events are also used by the high clergy .  They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post - Reformation period and <head>remained</head> unchallenged until the 1960s . As will be seen in Chapter 5 ,  understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society ,  and how the nation is to respect the divine order  established by God .  An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic ,  which began in the 1960s .

If they who are elected to legislate for our society should unfortunately decide to pass a disastrous measure of legislation that will allow the public promotion of contraception and an access hitherto unlawful to the means of contraception ,  they ought to know clearly the meaning of their action ,  when it is judged by the norms of objective morality  and the certain consequences of such a law It may well come to pass that legislation could be enacted that will offend the objective moral law  .  Such a measure would be an insult to our Faith ; it would without question prove to be gravely damaging to morality , private and public ; it would be , and would <head>remain</head> , a curse upon our country .

The process of industrialization and the accelerated growth of the division of labour had already wrested from the family ,  including its rural variant ,  its monopolistic role in the processes of production .  The family had changed ,  and its various functions of education ,  food production ,  and the manufacture of clothing were already in part relinquished to a variety of institutions whose smooth functioning rested on the intervention and guidance of the nation state .  The change in the socio - moral context was hardly recognized , and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had <head>remained</head> unformulated . In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,  it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,  it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,  and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic  nationalist alliance has still failed to solve .

At its annual meeting in Belfast ,  the Presbyterian General Assembly received a report promoting the amendment as implementing a rightful civil liberty  (  Irish Times  ,  6 June 1986 )  .  Further criticism came from Roman catholics in Britain .  An editorial in the Catholic Herald and Standard on 25 May it is distributed in Ireland as The Standard criticized the Irish bishops ' apparently low esteem of their laity 's ability to <head>remain</head> constant in their marriages . Also a call from the Alliance Party in the North was made by John Cushnahan ,  party leader .  He found it ironic that anyone who supported the Anglo - Irish Agreement could oppose a modest measure to introduce divorce  (  Irish Times  ,  28 June 1986 )  .

The biggest percentages favouring the proposal occurred in the urban centres ,  particularly Dublin and Dublin County ,  where there was a slight margin in favour .  But the country areas and particularly the West were overwhelmingly against the proposal .  It would seem that catholic nationalist morality is to <head>remain</head> a feature of the Southern state and of any future all - Ireland state , if the clerical church 's wishes continue to prevail . If an effective will to de - alienate Northern protestants in their attitudes to the republic existed ,  and if there had been a real change in the Irish catholic hierarchy 's  position on such matters ,  then they would indeed have taken positive steps to support FitzGerald 's  attempt to introduce such constitutional changes .  In other words ,  on the divorce question the Roman catholic clerical leadership were still using their joint authority ,  which is legitimate in the eyes of the majority in the Southern state ,  to press into civil legislation their views of public morality ,  and to use the informed conscience of the faithful as the primary vehicle .

This <head>remains</head> a fact no matter how one seeks to explain or excuse it . It is largely the case that  catholic nationalists go to one set of schools which have a visible catholic and nationalist ethos ,  and protestant loyalists go to another ,  some of which have a less visible protestant ethos ,  but all of which have a loyalist ethos as well .  Some catholic nationalists in the South mix with a proportionally much larger number of Southern protestants who ,  however ,  are loyal to the Southern state .

As such ,  the brewery has resolved to improve the operational efficiency of the building generally by remodelling the cellar area and the annexe building to the north and by giving the pub a frontage on Fleet Street .  Inevitably ,  this will entail losing some of the irreplaceable character of this unique building .

As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .  Series of interlinking metaphors of chaos and inhumanity are generated to maintain this dramatic mode and ensure that the agenda for control <head>remains</head> firmly with the system , and already I have used such metaphorical terms as animals and enemies to indicate some of the ways in which those in power make use of the rich imagination contained in everyday language . As Lakoff and Johnson  ( 1980 :  157 )  remind us :  whether in national politics or in everyday interaction ,  people in power get to impose their metaphors .  So when the police declare  ( as they do )  that they are non - political institution ,  this can only be a partial truth .

His ethnographic boundaries cannot be described as being geographically to the north of anywhere ,  for they are around him and within .

Usually the field trip is still an episodic visit to somewhere else ,  geographically to another culture from which the analyst can take leave or bring visitors too .  Returning to academia he can recall the spatial remove as being out there in the field ;  so that much of the current anthropology at home may still only be practising in its own backyard ,  pursuing an exploration of exotic cultures at home rather than looking into its own front room  ( Cheater 1987 :  166 )  .

In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos ,  a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem ,  and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they produce .  Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have <head>remained</head> the province of the archbishop and his clergy . The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner  ( 1989 )  ,  writing on the collective culture of chief constables ,  is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society ,  simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they operate ,  link together ,  or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions .

Claiming significant differences in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change .  His observational sample of prisoner interviews ,  although small ,  had found the PACE codes of practice were followed to the letter and he argued this showed that it required the sanction of the law to effect changes in interview and interrogation techniques .  A detective inspector shrugged this off , arguing from practical mastery and insider 's knowledge , that the practices of doing the business <head>remained</head> undisturbed outside of the PACE interview . He accepted there was no question that the PACE interviews Irving had witnessed would have been carried out with exactitude ,  but was certain that the negotiation of justice could easily continue outside of the world of the written custody record or file of evidence .  The fact that a sociologist was witnessing the interviews make it all the more certain they would be conducted with scrupulous care ,  but there was no way he would be given access to the extra - legal deals which may well have gone on outside the interview room or later during a prison visit for write - offs .

It may also be the reason why ,  in its forty - year history ,  the Police Staff College has never achieved any real academic status ;  for ,  as Lewis  ( ibid .  183 )  also points out :  there is a deep feeling that academic training gets between a policeman and his knowing and getting the respect of the crude masses of a very crude ,  very egalitarian and anti - intellectual European race the police  have indeed a general belief that they know more psychology than academics .  Always the demand is for practical skills , while academic analysis <head>remains</head> a despised pastime , so that even the Superintendents ' Association ( the equivalent of the Police Federation for the lower ranks ) has similarly denied any place for intellectualism for its members .

In 1988 a visiting colleague from the Royal Ulster Constabulary asked if it was part of my role in Systems Development Department to comment on such essays .  He told of his own difficulties in finding time to read all the variable essays submitted and knew of many that were never sent in at all .  For although Force Orders inevitably direct that such material will be submitted for assessment , it is typical that in a task - orientated institution which gives low priority or credence to the academic tome , the systems to ensure submission of the essays , or the ability to make much use of any useful ideas they contain , often <head>remains</head> sketchy . As the director of the Police Foundation ,  Barrie Irving  ( 1984 :  4 )  commented ,  Unlike their American counterparts ,  the British police community ,  together with their administrators ,  do not devour large quantities of written material and if a research project does not produce results which can be acted upon no amount of careful editing and dissemination will make an impact .  Research in the police ,  Irving further asserts ,  is a matter of pragmatics ,  eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,  or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .

These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,  the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .  Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many sorts of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation <head>remains</head> intact and now appears to be well - established . So much for the basic laws .  The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers ,  and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation ,  has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels  ( spiking frequencies )  in the appropriate sensory pathways .

Age Concern believes that Mobility Allowance should be extended to those who become disabled after 65 and that payment should continue regardless of age .  HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES  The idea of care in the community has developed over the past 20 years to encourage the development of services to help older people in need of care to <head>remain</head> in their own homes for as long as they wish , and for as long as is practical . Old age is not a disease in itself ,  and it is not helpful to think of the problems which face older people as being caused by their age .  Older people are not necessarily ill or frail  most are fit and active .

On the positive side ,  a milestone was reached in 1984 when the old vacuum - braked wagonload network was finally abandoned and all worthwhile traffic transferred to the air - braked Speedlink system .  The principle of Speedlink is that train sections are exchanged at specified groups of sidings on the network ,  rather than individual wagons sorted at full - scale marshalling yards .  On certain routes Speedlink has served BR and its customers well , with many trunk trains running to capacity ; but the economics of running three - or fourwagon feeder services at the periphery of the network have <head>remained</head> questionable . Some worthwhile traffic gains were made during the 1980s ,  such as timber from the Scottish Highlands and drinks from several locations in the South West .  But equally notable were the losses ,  such as the once substantial Rowntrees traffic from York .

Ashton 's  careful build - up to this climax makes Vera 's  discovery of them in each other 's  arms all the more poignant because she shows a child - like petulance at losing one she so longed to have for her own .

The Tutor <head>remains</head> a sympathetic character fur Vera , s sorrow at his departure is echoed by Kolia , Natalia 's son , when he too realises he is losing the only person who has tried to make him happy .

Certainly Ashton makes a clear distinction between the dances of the Fairies and those of the Mechanicals .

The arms usually change after each brief enchanement  .  Their movement also depends upon which foot is in front .  If the right foot <head>remains</head> there for several bars , the arms will be held still , but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change . There is also a tendency to pause in a pose at the end of a phrase and for a deliberate change to be made before further dance .

The Condor combines Karrimor 's  sophisticated and fully adjustible SA back system with a cavernous internal space ,  just right for long expeditions and long distance backpacking .  A correctly fitting sack is essential to enjoyable walking ,  especially when carrying a heavy load and the SA harness and hip belt on the Condor have been beefed up a bit from the Jaguar and Panther models .  The SA system allows the shoulder straps to be adjusted up and down aluminium struts and held in place with straps and buckles , while the lumber support pad and hip belt <head>remain</head> stationary . A smaller SA system is available for people with smaller backs ,  but unfortunately not on the Condor .  Size is quickly adjusted with compression straps and full - length zipped gussets ,  although this system all adds to the sack 's  2.4kg .

Equally ,  why is it not pointed up that philanthropic murder and the Napoleonic idea and all other theorizing come unstuck here ?

The fact <head>remains</head> that Porfiry does break , or tame , Raskolnikov , and that an enterprise lucid in prospect becomes fogbound by the chance which brings Lizaveta home unexpectedly . She ,  the simple mender and dealer in second - hand clothes ,  happens to return as she happens to keep getting pregnant  and what fuller and neater manifestation of chance than that ,  than conceiving and being conceived ?

And it should be noted that the actual breaking point for Raskolnikov in the novel is the  illness which induces his apocalyptic science - fiction nightmare of germs and Possessed   - type madness and destruction ,  bringing him literally to Sonya 's  feet and both of them to the dawn of a new future ,  of a full resurrection into a new life which will be the subject of another story .  So having laid the weight of mystic ,  creative suffering on Sonya ,  the novel proceeds to hive it off into its own Epilogue where all strains and difficulties are waved away .  What the Sonya of the novel has to do with Christ and resurrection and creative suffering <head>remains</head> fleeting and indirect , though no less wonderful for that . In the original version ,  now lost ,  of the chapter in which she reads to Raskolnikov the gospel story of the raising of Lazarus ,  Dostoevsky intended and wrote a head - on debate about Christianity ;  but his publishers refused to print it .  The novelist was very distressed .

Looked at another way ,  The Possessed  and the two remaining novels he had in him to write ,  A Raw Youth  and The Brothers Karamazov  ,  are all generation - gap stories ,  and for Dostoevsky the generation gap is only subordinately topical and tendentious and mixed up with Turgenev .  How much of the great - sinner project <head>remained</head> unachieved and how much dissolved itself into the books that in fact got written , can be debated endlessly .

What made the ruling even more surprising was that the Japanese government had pledged to correct bias in school textbooks after South Korea and China lodged diplomatic protests in 1982 ,  when the book was originally banned .  The reason given for the ban was that Professor Saburo Ienaga ,  a noted historian ,  had refused to strike out a reference in his book to bacteriological and other experiments carried out on Chinese prisoners of war by the now - defunct Imperial Army .

This is partly thanks to the free insurance provided by one of the World Cup sponsors and partly historical perspective .  Yes ,  all the trattoria owners in the Via Roma will be irritated by however many broken windows and cracked heads come their way .  But when you have a 4,000 - year history of being <head>ruled</head> by Phoenicians , Carthaginians , Romans , Goths , Spaniards and British ( 1718 ) , a fortnight 's foraging by the bleached denim wing of the industrial proletariat is barely worth a shrug . The man charged with keeping the foragers in check is Mr Carlo Porceddu ,  security chief for the local World Cup Organisation .  A lawyer ,  he lives in one of the swish apartment blocks which sprang out of the rubble left by the last act of licensed hooliganism to hit Cagliari ,  namely the second world war .

Much later we read :  Everything seemed to indicate that Jaromil 's  enormous yearning for newness  ( the religion of the New )  was only the disguised longing of a virginal youth for the unimaginable experience of the sex act .

Weather watch Guard against the harmful effects of extreme weather by watering plants before drought becomes critical ,  and making sure excessive rainfall can drain away freely .  Site is as important as soil , for plants that prefer full sun , shade or <head>shelter</head> may not thrive if planted in the wrong place , and are then more likely to succumb . A regular walk around the garden to make sure everything is growing healthily is the simplest precaution of all ,  often revealing preliminary signs of trouble .  In addition to maintaining positive plant health ,  there are several ways to avoid the probability of serious pest attacks ,  or at least lessen their impact ,  which in turn will cut down on the need to apply pesticides .

What the paper scathingly called the story of the refugees had been whipped up by a noisy propaganda campaign dripping with chauvinism and nationalism .  And behind the West German media stood the country 's  politicians ,  nursing illusions about the recreation of a new German Reich with the pre - war frontiers of 1937 .  Such language is infinitely more virulent that anything emanating from the Soviet foreign ministry after the deal four days ago between Bonn and East Berlin , which allowed some some 5,000 East Germans who had taken <head>shelter</head> in the two embassies to leave unmolested for the West . Hitherto its spokesmen have insisted that the affair was essentially one for East Germany to settle ,  albeit urging that West Germany must operate its embassies abroad in conformity with standard international practice .  To an extent ,  the anger is to be expected from a newspaper which has become a strident mouthpiece of conservative elements in the Kremlin leadership .

Due to the incompetence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ethiopia ,  their condition rapidly deteriorated .

The distribution of food , water and <head>shelter</head> was chaotic . Some refugees managed to obtain extra ration cards ,  and at the Harshin and Hartishek camps food repeatedly ran out before everyone had received their ration .  There were several riots ,  and local Ethiopian troops opened fire more than once to quell the angry refugees .

The village is almost completely destroyed ,  which is not surprising ,  due to the bombardments that it has been subjected to since 6th June by British artillery and naval guns .

By the number of enemy dead lying about the fields and approaches to the village , the British attacks have finally forced them to move out , taking <head>shelter</head> in a slit trench during a German mortar attack , everyone keeping their heads down.

In harbour the rig is usually opened out to its full water width of six metres ,  and the four independently suspended wheels can be retracted into the main hull ,  so that it appears to squat on the ground .

It also has the added advantage that , by spreading a canopy over the on - board crane , a <head>shelter</head> can be made in which to sleep and cook when in harbour . As the afternoon turned into a slightly cooler early evening ,  each crew methodically checked over their rig .

For this reason ,  many of these structures have disappeared .  The number and size of the buildings of the farmstead was affected not only by the size of the farm but also by the type of farming practised .  On an arable farm with only a few cattle kept to make manure , little provision would be made for these animals , but there would be one or more barns , stables and <head>shelters</head> for carts . On a mixed farm ,  there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle ,  while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops .  It is interesting to note that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them .

The two rode about the parish together ,  and after a second visit Mr Brown produced a planting plan and a bill for 73.10s .

The new farmsteads were being built at the same time , set snugly into <head>shelter</head> belts of oak , beech and elm , nursed up by Scots pines . Sir Christopher designed most of the buildings himself ,  but left the design of The Castle ,  to the terrifically fashionable architect John Carr of York ,  who had been taken up by the Yorkshire gentry after his triumph with the design for the grandstand on the racecourse at Knavesmire .  The Castle was built as an eye catcher ,  to be glimpsed from the library window of Sledmere ,  as though some forgotten castle had been crumbling in its wood for centuries .

There is a fantastic intensity and wildness ,  almost savagery ,  in the landscapes of Spain ,  and Catalonia ,  delivered from the Arabs by Charlemagne ,  is no exception .  I travelled among grotesque rock formations ,  past gorges and canyons ,  weird spectres of fanes and fortresses on distant isolated heights ,  small villages strung along spines of haggard cliffs .  In the Goya wail paintings today fittingly displayed in the Prado , and in many of his other works , one sees again and again these formidable elephantine rocks lowering over a cringing humanity trying to find <head>shelter</head> in a bandit landscape . The piercing brilliance of the late afternoon sunlight seems to intensify the surrealism of the constantly changing scenery .  The first glimpse of Montserrat is always deeply moving as it begins to rise like a vast ragged curtain on the evening horizon ,  mysterious and slightly sinister in its grandeur as it looms ever nearer in Goya - like menace ,  shifting from side to side of the bus until it vanishes behind us .

Foals who have learnt to evade bot - flies in such a way ,  will continue to do so as adult horses if they have access to shelter. Older horses who do n't try and run away from bot - flies ,  usually have not had the use of shelter sheds when they were young ,  so have formed the habit of no longer attempting to evade these injurious insects .

Older horses get locked into habits .  Thus we need to be especially careful what we do with young horses so that the habits they establish are in their interests and not to their detriment .  We 've considered the advantages of foals learning about <head>shelter</head> , some other habits of importance concern food . Foals at a very early age start to copy their mothers and to nibble grass .  Then ,  if the mares are given hay and grain the foals again copy their mothers and learn to eat the new food .

Nevertheless ,  it is also clear that there is scope for increasing the agricultural production of the crofts .  Some of us felt that more attention could be paid to this aspect ,  particularly in order to obtain a greater economic return for the heavy expenditure on government assistance .  The principal way in which the agricultural production of the crofts has been increased is through the improvement of pasture by fencing , planting <head>shelter</head> - belts , liming ( usually with shell sand ) , fertilizing and surface seeding . Although such improvement has been vigorously promoted by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture  ( which is responsible for agricultural extension and training in the area )  ,  the response has ,  after some initial enthusiasm ,  been extremely disappointing .  By 1979 only about 6,000 ha in Lewis and Harris  ( no more than 4 %  of the total common grazing )  had been the subject of the grants available under the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme .

The indexes ,  in Latin and English ,  are followed by seven practical lists ,  similar to those in the catalogues of many leading nurserymen today and they can still be consulted to advantage .  The author directs attention to the all - important consideration of scale :  We often see some of the smallest growing shrubs placed where the largest trees should have been planted .  The first list deals with hardy , deciduous trees and shrubs thriving in this country without <head>shelter</head> and has a key to their height , flowers and scent . Miller liked his ground cover to be permanent and he has not included any of the undershrubs ,  which are of short duration ,  such as Southernwood ,  Rosemary ,  Lavender ,  Lavender Cotton ,  etc. because whenever these decay ,  they occasion gaps in the plantation .  Next he grouped the climbing ,    shrubby plants needing support or fastening and these are followed by hardy evergreen trees and shrubs .

PROBLEMS OF SHELTER The impact of the migrants has varied from country to country ,  but two areas which stand out as having been profoundly affected throughout the continent are housing and employment .  Initially it was the basic problem of <head>shelter</head> that attracted social scientists , with the result that the main concern was for the home environment of the poor . The rapidly increasing urban population has placed an impossible strain on the provision of housing .  The housing deficit in Mexico is about 4 million units ,  which means that about 30 per cent of the population is in need of housing  ( Hurtado 1986 )  .

The turner thesis has been criticised by Marxists for overemphasising the differences between the slum dwellers and the squatters .  They argue that the differential in living standards between the two groups is minimal and to see this as social mobility is to detract attention from the important fact that they are all part of the large urban poor whose poverty is due to the wider social formation and ,  in particular ,  the capitalist mode of production .  Self - help schemes relieve the state of the immediate necessity of providing housing and offer a cheap source of <head>shelter</head> , thus making it possible for the poor to survive on very low incomes ( Burgess 1978 ) . The criticisms of both marginality and the Turner thesis have suggested that the problems of spontaneous housing cannot be fully understood without some reference to the wider society .  The initial founding of a squatter settlement is ,  itself ,  an illegal act and ,  therefore ,  a challenge to authority .

There are many types of bin sold to keep the compost area tidy and clean ,  or you can make your own .  An activator may be used to speed up the process but certain basic principles should be borne in mind .  First , the layers of plant refuse should be 6to 12 in depth ; second , the heap should have some <head>shelter</head> if possible from sun and wind , to prevent drying - out and loss of heat ; third , a supply of nitrogen can be incorporated in alternate layers . If the compost is intended for your vegetable garden ,  you can use hydrated lime in the alternate layers ,  but beware of this if you plan to use the compost on rhododendrons ,  azaleas or other lime - hating plants .  If turned ,  two or three times ,  the heap will decompose without getting too hot or becoming mildewed .

It is a strongly rural range of occupations ,  and it is especially striking how few were regular manual employees .  Most were casual or self - employed workers who could not be made to retire ,  and many were also small property - holders  an important factor which also made their position stronger for continuing at work .  One old couple who were village publicans used their house as a <head>shelter</head> for a very composite family which included a daughter who did the pub cooking , a brother , and a son who used two rooms as his tailor 's shop . Even two of the farmhands rented a smallholding where they could grow vegetables and keep cows ,  pigs ,  and poultry ;  while another was also a carter .  Because they continued to be economically independent ,  these working older people ,  both men and women ,  were often remembered as strong characters ,  like the Lancashire shopkeeping grandmother ,  a powerful personality who was without any doubt boss of the concern ,  or the old North Welsh woman who was doing all the cobbling for the neighbours in Berthengam ,  and they were done by her well .

Many of them were possible only if the NILP got control of Stormont and were propaganda points in its ideological war against the doctrines of Orange and Green .

This ignored the fact that many had been created out of poor arable land or even poorer scrub .  The great park at Petworth was described by Arthur Young in 1793 as previously consisting only of bushes ,  furze ,  some timber and rubbish of no kind of use .  Despite ploughing , despite the ravages of age and elm disease on park trees , the essential features of parks often survive namely , the encircling <head>shelter</head> belts and individual clumps of trees , and the lakes . As has been made clear in the discussion of country houses ,  parks and the houses that stand within them are inseparable .

The importance of grazing both cows and sheep over the same land  ( either together or in succession )  ,  both for the good of the sward and the health of the livestock ,  is explained at the beginning of Chapter 6 .  Set stocking ,  in which animals are given free range over a relatively large area and not moved regularly ,  is the most labour - saving system of grazing .  The provision of water may well be easier and <head>shelter</head> in foul weather more readily available somewhere in a large area than in a small paddock or strip . The main disadvantages of set stocking are the buildup of intestinal worms and the growth of tussocks of coarse ,  unpalatable grass where animals have dunged .  Paddock grazing ,  in which the grassland is divided into small paddocks ,  grazed hard for a short period and then rested for up to three weeks ,  is a very good system for the control of parasite worms ,  the life cycle of which is broken during the rest periods .

Nearer our own time ,  in 1830 ,  when the extensive manor of Ingleton changed hands ,  the new owner had a tower intended as a hospice erected on the summit ,  made from stone pillaged from the wall and the foundations of the huts .  The edifice was short lived :  on the day of the opening ceremony ,  the assembled crowd of visitors got out of control during the festivities and dismantled the building ,  reducing it to the great heap of stones to be seen today .  Nearby , a wall <head>shelter</head> intended as a wind break , was fitted with a view indicator in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II . The summit is 2373 feet above the sea ,  not a great altitude ,  but to the many pilgrims who climb to it time and time again ,  it is a stepping stone to heaven .   For me and the growing number of cavers and potholers ,  the fascination of Ingleborough is centred on the band of limestone at and below mid - height .

Beyond ,  where the private grounds are left ,  a track from Clapdale Farm is joined and the walk continues in a more open environment along the valley of Clapham Beck to the massive limestone cliff where Ingleborough Cave ,  sometimes called Clapham Cave ,  opens to daylight .  This is a show cave ,  open to the public when a guide is in attendance ;  the charge for admittance is rewarded by a splendid display of natural carvings and formations and many named features .

OMO 1 was passed by the Railway Inspector in April 1972 ,  and after trial runs on the Promenade during the season ,  went into service on the Fleetwood route that winter .

All <head>shelters</head> had to be altered so that queues faced the trams , new signs were erected and the traditional round stop - signs disappeared . No less than 170 conductor - posts were saved by the introduction of one - man buses and trams between 1969 and 1976 ,  but the tramway was saved too !  Technical improvements to the riding qualities of the OMO cars ,  followed the replacement of the traditional steel springs by rubber suspension .

The eldest Miss Fricker never forgot the arrival of the travel - weary student whose brilliant reputation had gone so powerfully before him. Brown as a berry ,  his clothes worn out ,  and his hair in need of cutting ,  he appeared before them as a dreadful figure ,  though one whose torrential eloquence was unabated .  Lovell gave Coleridge food that night , but not <head>shelter</head> , and in the days that followed was responsible with Southey for introducing him to a city strong in religious dissent and political radicalism . One meeting of particular significance was with a young dissenting bookseller called Joseph Cottle ,  whose shop stood at the corner of Corn Street and High Street ,  a few yards from Southey 's  birthplace .  Cottle ,  who four years later was to publish the Lyrical Ballads  and in old age produced his garrulous and unreliable Reminiscences  ,  immediately saw in Coleridge the signs of commanding genius ,  but reserved for Southey 's  great suavity of manners his more enthusiastic praise .

During one excursion which probably occurred at this time Tom Poole took his friends to Walford 's  Gibbet on the Quantock slopes between Holford and Stowey ,  and there recounted John Walford 's  tragic history .  Walford ,  a charcoal - burner who had spent his solitary life in a woodland shelter built of poles and turf ,  was remembered by Tom Poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity ,  but one who also possessed ardent feelings and strong passions .  He was deeply in love with an Over Stowey woman called Ann Rice , but was forced into marriage to a half - mad girl who had visited him at his <head>shelter</head> and who bore him two illegitimate children . They married in June 1789 ,  and a month later ,  in despair and rage ,  he murdered her as they walked in the darkness to the Castle of Comfort Inn .  He was soon arrested ,  largely through the efforts of Tom Poole 's  father ,  and was sentenced to be hanged in chains .

In Kuwait ,  Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee  ( 1988 )  have shown that aeolian deposition has resulted in decreased productivity or complete failure of many agricultural enterprises .  In contrast to the Sahel zone which is classified as semi - arid ,  Kuwait is arid  (  Desertification Map of the World  ,  FAO/Unesco 1977 )  so it is to be expected that desertification is a prominent problem and a major agent of environmental change .  In the Abdaly region of northern Kuwait there are some 156 farms which are separated by desert and thus exposed to sandstorms , where metal wind - breaks and <head>shelter</head> - belts have not prevented sand encroachment , largely as Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee have suggested , due to poor management . Similar problems have occurred in the Al - Wafra region in the south of Kuwait ,  where desert encroachment has led to the abandonment of farms .  Here the annual rate of sand encroachment is  which is in excess of the average annual rate of sand encroachment of   ( Khalaf 1989 )  .

Moreover ,  Kebin and Kaiguo  ( 1989 )  describe the measures suggested by the Project of Protective Forest System which was approved by the government in 1978 to improve conditions in northern China .  Between 1978 and 1985 some 5.3 10 6 ha were planted with trees , shrubs and herbs , including a sand - fixation forest belt of 700 000 ha , another 700 000 ha of <head>shelter</head> - belts for arable land and 170 000 ha of shelter - belts for pasture . Eventually some 8  106 ha will be planted to constitute the Green Great Wall .  Kebin and Kaiguo also report that grazing and wood removal for firewood are prohibited near oases and villages and that these measures ,  plus tree planting and irrigation ,  have been effective in reclaiming parts of Gansu Province .

If you have not paid tax ,  then you would not be able to sign a Certificate of Deduction of Tax and ACET would not be able to reclaim tax on the covenant .

You may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the UK .

In contrast ,  the restaurant manager is far less easy to define .  I would argue that they are as charismatic as chefs and yet their skills are less tangible and harder to gauge .

Tact and diplomacy ,  knowledge and friendship define the great restaurant managers ,  just as a great chef is defined by his skills in producing superb food .

This leaves generality as a real capacity of the mind .  Philosophers have often been content to assign to the mind features that they are unwilling to ascribe to the physical world .  Most empiricists , for example , have been prepared to do this with secondary qualities , such as colours , sounds and <head>smells</head> , which , they believe , science could not allow to the external world . In so doing ,  they claim that it is not just secondary qualities that are confined to the mind ,  but ,  with them ,  the whole vivid force of the world - as - we - perceive - it ,   -  what some philosophers call the manifest image  of the world  which is intrinsically bound up with the secondary qualities .  David Hume went further ,  transferring causal power from the world of objects to the mind ,  making of it a tendency of the mind to pass from the thing we call the cause to the one we call the effect .

America is his favourite way of talking about the undiscovered country ,  and it shows that as well as suicide and blanket boredom he has taken over the flavour of Raskolnikov 's  joke about getting used to family life .  Dostoevsky 's  notebook word tone  amounts to more than dust and mortar and summer smells ;  it catches up human beings and entangles them with the city .  It 's no accident that Svidrigailov is the only one in the novel to handle yellow paper money , just as it 's no accident that children are frightened of him and run away in indescribable terror because ( so we understand in our bones ) they <head>smell</head> death on him , or rather the unattachment to life which defeats even Sonya Marmeladov . The girl who has reached the human being in Raskolnikov the murderer is left for the last time by Svidrigailov bewildered and frightened ,  and filled with vague and oppressive suspicions .  He has just walked out into a spectacular summer storm .

C. A. Wood and F. Marjorie Fyfe ,  1943 )  .  He appears under the name he was given in his orphaned youth  the Boy from Apulia .  And with him comes Ciullo d'Alcamo , whose Rosa Fresca aulentissima was translated by D.G . Rossetti : Thou sweetly - <head>smelling</head> fresh red rose/ That near thy summer art . This poem ,  and its author ,  figure in The Spirit of Romance  ,  as showing that Italian poetry taking up from Provence originated not in Tuscany but Sicily .  Though Ciullo by Rossetti 's  reckoning composed  the poem in the 1170s ,  at least twenty years before Frederick Hohenstaufen came to the throne of Sicily ,  Pound in The Spirit of  Romance  juxtaposes the two names ,  presumably as an instigation  though to what ,  it is not easy to say .

Half - anhour later we turned into a gateway leading to a small cottage .  The front door was open ,  as we approached ,  a light came on ,  probably from an oil lamp .  I could now <head>smell</head> the very strong aroma of frying onions as we entered the cottage . The scene before me reminded me of the very similar scenes in the Highland crofts ,  the only difference being the now almost overpowering smell of onions .  In the dim light of the oil lamp hanging from a chain attached to a very black beam above the fireplace ,  and the glow from the log fire .

The film was Snow White  ;  and I felt my sanity slipping until the moment when the queen metamorphosed into the witch .  Then I screamed and screamed ,  and could not stop .  My mother called an usherette to have me removed , and I was handed into strange - <head>smelling</head> arms behind a bright beam that dazzled me . The arms hugged my squirming form and carried me out ,  while my mother stayed to watch the rest of the film .  But the exit was at the foot of the screen ,  and I was being borne up towards that great and drooling hag ,  away from safety ,  pinioned by someone I could n't see ,  and the witch was laughing .

When you plan a display ,  include scented flowers ,  either shop - bought or home - grown ,  so that your arrangement smells as good as it looks .  Simple to grow scented climbers include many lilies ,  petunias ,  lily - of - the - valley ,  tobacco plants ,  pinks and carnations ,  honey - scented buddleia ,  narcissus ,  sweet peas ,  freesias and summer jasmine .  Add honeysuckle ( not all the varieties <head>smell</head> so check before buying that it is fragrant ) and climbing roses . Many of the older rose varieties also have a strong scent .

It was pleasant to lie and think of other Februaries and see himself abroad at dusk in the fields under a chilling rain ,  standing in a cart hunched up against the storm ,  bending and rising and bending again to toss turnips to the streaming cattle ,  listening to their soft thud in the mud and the straining of the horse as his hooves sucked and sank ,  the cattle lowing plaintively and the sharp crunch of their scooping teeth .  Then back to the farmyard to untackle and fodder the horse , to strip off his own thatch of soaked sacking , and milk cows by the light of a lantern that swung from a hook in the roof and <head>smelled</head> sharply in contrast with the milky smell of steaming cows and the less agreeable smell of fresh dung .

In our brains ,  the cerebrum  ( the part connected to the olfactory ,  and other senses )  controls our subliminal consciousness ,  determining the threshold of our sensory perceptions .  In time ,  spraying on the same scent habitually can make us completely insensitive to it .  By varying your perfume choice with the frequency you change your smalls , you never build up that resistance ( and thereby avoid the risk of all but suffocating colleagues in a crowded lift with too much Shalimar while you still ca n't <head>smell</head> a thing ) . Also ,  hormonal changes during the month can alter the chemistry of a perfume on our skin ,  so what smells great today may be decidedly iffy by next Thursday .  Of course ,  nowadays ,  fashions in fragrance do mirror those in clothes ;  it 's  no coincidence may of the world 's  best - sellers have been created by top designers .

Electric lighting too ,  though disliked by Haussmann because of its coldness and considered by him as suitable only for illuminating building works at night ,  was nevertheless used for decorative purposes .

The Emperor ,  however ,  envisaged a city which was not only light and clean but also full of air .

In some respects however lack of acceptability is desirable .  For products that are expensive and only used sporadically an unattractive product may be chosen if it has an exceptional performance as its handling characteristics will ensure that it is only used as a last resort and not used casually when other cheaper products would suffice .

If it is warm enough for the patient to sit in the garden ,  he may enjoy just watching all the garden life .  However ,  he is likely to feel much more satisfied if he can take an active part in looking after the plants .

The writer is able to measure artists not only against each other but also against standards of technical achievement .  Here is a passage from a classic work on etching and engraving ,  about Drer :  He was <head>solid</head> , scientific , conscious in all his creating , learning his art from masters who were still in the youth of artistic development , his whole work shows a progress towards an ideal which the trammels of Gothic tradition never left him free to attain without a struggle . By the very energy spent in its realisation ,  his accomplishment is all the more intense in its expression .  He recognised the truest limits of the medium in which he worked ,  never allowed technical virtuosity to have the better of the central aim of significant composition ,  and established a balanced style which remains the most perfect model of the line - engraver 's  art .

He makes a particular point of technique .  In the chapter on technique the author describes the process of carving a figure from a wood with particular properties .  First the hard heartwood was removed , making the intended figure hollow at the back ; the sculptor avoided <head>solid</head> masses , unstable in wood ( though preferred by sculptors in a material like sandstone ) ; finally in the carving , forms were decided partly to avoid the hazards of the sapwood shrinking and splitting . Limewood is contrasted with oak ,  and the chapter finishes :  The properties of the material made limewood sculpture a special medium .

It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century .  But its opposition also had a base in the property - owning ,  rural peasantry ,  and middle - classes ,  who had in the nineteenth century paid a heavy price for their liberation from oppression and whose status became rooted in their property ,  land ,  and livestock .  Their attitudes were shared by their priest - sons , who in their turn were supported by Rome , whose <head>solid</head> opposition to socialism until the 1960s was very clear ( e.g. Pope Leo XIII , 1903 ) . From 1911 to 1914 ,  the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .

With the emergence of the statelet in 1922 ,  covenant politics was subordinated to the Stormont alliance only to re - emerge after Stormont 's  collapse in 1972 .  In 1971 ,  a new covenant was signed by over half a million men and women ,  committing protestants to a renewal of the covenant political ideal .  Miller ( 1978 ) suggests that the contractarian element was no longer ever so <head>solid</head> . Be that as it may ,  it may turn out that the preparedness not to acquiesce in any all - Ireland solution is decidedly stronger than most commentators until recently were prepared to accept ,  except for the work of Bew ,  Gibbon ,  and Patterson .   Thus ,  protestant loyalists fight incorporation into a united Ireland for the reason that their perception of protestantism and their values of polity contain a powerful rejection of catholic monopoly ,  which they identify with catholicism tout court  .

They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect , the insider who reveals the structural formations of a system of power inverts that power and the revelation creates a situation where elements of anti - structure ( Turner 1969 , 1974 ) now present a version of how things might be constituted ; and what has been seen as <head>solid</head> reality begins to be identified as only one social possibility . In this observing participation ,  the thick description which Geertz  ( 1975 )  argued for comes hurtling at the ethnographer ,  so that the classic use of an anthropological informant is hardly necessary .  Rather it will be a case of the researcher finding a means of recording and sorting the mass of detail which continuously bombards him and presents him with the lateral possibilities which make the discipline potentially dangerous .

In 1990 ,  over 5,000 school teams competed in the various Midland Bank sponsored national schools competitions and figures received so far suggest even more in 1991 .  The development of a Tennis Teachers Course offers help to the non - coach teacher ,  and the inauguration of County Schools Tennis Associations  ( there are now 39 )  has enabled locally based courses to be set up. We have prepared a wide - ranging study kit for GCSE , which will be available next term , and preparations are in hand for a scheme to construct <head>solid</head> links between schools and their local tennis club . Perhaps most significant of all is the launch of the National Schools Coaching Programme .

If the ribs  ( sides )  are thinner ,  as suggested  ( about 1.5mm )  hot bending will not be necessary and a better shape can be achieved by the use of a simple jig to hold the ribs while the glue dries .  The use of small glue blocks along the inside of the joint is also a good idea .  If the instrument is to be resonant the apparently <head>solid</head> finger board needs to be hollowed out from underneath , leaving about 6mm of wood top and sides and openings cut through the soundboard ( face ) to link this space to the interior of the instrument . If you are using guitar machine heads  ( far more easily adjusted than pegs ,  which also require special tools to fit them accurately )  it is more convenient to modify the shape of the head and fit them only on the left  ( if you are right - handed )  in the manner of Fender guitars .  If you want symmetry make sure you get the right number of left or right - handed machines .

When it comes to choosing which machine to buy I would suspect that our requirements would be rather different from your own .  This a busy commercial workshop .

Each machine is probably used by half a dozen different people every day .  Some of them may be less careful with it than others so we need machines that can take a battering .  Not , I hope , that ny of my staff or students would batter any of my old ladies but my machines have to be very <head>solid</head> and reliable . A workshop with one machinist who carefully adjusts and sets the machine up and leaves it that way at the end of the job is not necessarily going to need the heaviest equipment .  I know it is a terribly sexist remark but I do think of the machines in our first workshop as old ladies .

Your questions Moveable tops Q We constantly read that when making table tops and the like from <head>solid</head> timber , one should not fix finishing pieces across the end - grain because the greater lateral expansion across the grain will break the glue joint eventually .

The downstairs lighting circuit is run under the first - floor floorboards ,  with cables preferably threaded through holes drilled in the centre of joists ,  or clipped to the sides of the joists .  To run cable down to light switches or to wall lights , it will usually be necessary to chase slots in <head>solid</head> walls , though if you are rewiring a house which was originally wired in metal conduit , you may be able to use the existing conduit buried in the plaster leading to light switches to feed the cable down. Chasing solid walls is done with a bolster chisel and club hammer ,  and it is important to keep the cables vertical so that you know where they are .  Ideally ,  cables should be covered with metal half - channel before the plaster is made good with filler or a d - i - y plaster :  you will ,  of course ,  have to redecorate the wall afterwards .

What size should battens for supporting cladding be ,  and how are they fixed ?   Wall battens are usually 38119mm ,  or 5025mm in cross - section ,  and should be fixed to the walls either with masonry nails or with non - rusting screws driven into wallplugs .  Nails should penetrate about 10mm into <head>solid</head> masonry and should not be driven into mortar joints . If you are fixing battens over existing rendering make sure they are long enough to give adequate penetration into the brickwork or blockwork beneath .  While cladding can be fixed directly to existing masonry walls ,  it is good practice to cover them with waterproof building paper first to prevent any moisture that gets behind the cladding from penetrating the wall itself .

No one ,  he thinks ,  who is unfamiliar with Pound 's  P.T .  Barnumising for the visual arts will know what to make of it .

No one who reads the three <head>solid</head> essays in what is described as the catalogue of the exhibition ( though it is n't quite that ) can think that Barnumising in any way describes Pound 's ardent response to painting and sculpture , photography and architecture , first in London 19081920 , then in Paris 19201925 , and thereafter in Italy . Carpenter ,  predictably ,  finds the three essayists  Richard Humphreys ,  John Alexander and Peter Robinson  taking a rather solemn approach to the whole thing ;  whereas ,  he assures us ,  Pound 's  exertions on behalf of these arts partook more than a little of the amiable joke .  Before it is through ,  Pound 's  centenary year will bring on indigestion in even the most devoted Poundians .

What makes a successful indie label ?  Everyone has their own idea but history shows that certain elements are essential to the long term success of an indie .

This is called niche marketing which is a familiar concept in all forms of retailing .

The critical promoter of the work of Seurat and his friends was Flix Fnon ,  a subtle stylist who varied his methods according to the work he was describing ;  he used expository language for Degas ,  but he dropped logical connection in language ,  even verbs when discussing Monet 's  spontaneous art .  In arguing for pointillism ,  he quoted the scientific treatises consulted by Seurat and even printed mathematical equations .  Fnon possessed a dry wit , honed to a sharp edge by journalism ; he was a specialist in the <head>sort</head> of notes usually titled as News in brief , but in France called faits divers ( Sundry facts ) . He made these three - liners into sardonic comments which undercut the banalities of the newspaper in which they appeared .  As a critic ,  his descriptions of paintings were phrased with exceptional care.

He described this aesthetic response as the bed - rock of conservative criticism .  For him ,  critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture .  A different <head>sort</head> of response to art is to use it as a means of learning more about the society in which it was produced ; this may be felt by a theoretician to be more important than to know the artist 's intentions , which , it can be argued , are determined by society . Or ,  the effect of a painting may be compared with those of other means of communication ,  such as photography ,  film or television .  there is every reason to welcome such studies ,  though a reader hoping for judgements about quality may be disappointed by a theoretical writer 's  greater stress on interpretation .

Formal differences in art have been linked to places in varied ways ,  one of the best - known Renaissance contrasts being the stress on line  evident in Florentine art as against the colourist approach of the Venetians ,  a city on water .  Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate ?  Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special <head>sort</head> of vision on Dutch artists ? The reverse of the coin is internationalism ,  a feature ,  some might say ,  of twentieth - century art ;  not so uncommon either in other periods ,  where art historians struggle heroically to identify differences between the art of one country and another .  Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .

Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes ,  perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance ,  when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's  Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard .  for art historians ,  incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ;  but a critic takes an interest in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art .  The main strength of this <head>sort</head> of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation . As a book on a single subject ,  there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration ,  while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph .  The interpretation of imagery ,  the circumstances of production ,  the place of the work in the artist 's  career ,  the historical context ,  the precise information about the work 's  appearance and condition ,  these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .

According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga ,  written in 1622 and published by A.

This <head>sort</head> of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste , though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ; for example , Tietze 's entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it . The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .  As the decades have gone by ,  scholarly work has piled up ,  so that this category of book has taken a larger ,  longer and much more expensive form than before .

The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,  contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a degree of respect deriving partly from their academic connections .  Another <head>sort</head> of authority derives from money , which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object . Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition ,  as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .  Incidentally ,  the good art critic should be the reader 's  friend in refusing to be impressed by art market prices .

To suggest ,  as I do ,  that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience ,  fed to satiety on brilliant innovation ,  frenzied novelty and every sort of spontaneous expression ,  that ,  after all ,  permanence ,  grandeur ,  deliberation ,  lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's work , which , incidentally , was a <head>sort</head> of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time . He argued that Braque enhanced objects :  He is infinitely kind to all the things that go into his pictures .

How then is the reader of art criticism best advised to use criticism to follow the fortunes of artists ?  One policy is to try to see more than one review of any exhibition .  The notice board at a show where notices are pinned up will give the general idea of what <head>sort</head> of reviews have been written . It is a usual feature of such a comparison that there is a basic level of information which is common to most of the reviews ,  and it is the mark of a skilful critic to have worked in some personal assessment of works ,  or some individual response to the show as a whole .  The data common to all reviews can be discounted as being neither criticism nor evaluation .

Pechorin is a cold - hearted ,  stylish fatalist ,  experimentalist ,  existentialist and divided man ,  a traveller ,  gambler ,  heart - breaker and forgetter of old friends ,  who loves to ride a spirited horse through the long grass against a desert wind .

In all this sharp distinguishing ,  in all this enemy thing that Amis has ,  there are elements of anxiety ,  and of misrepresentation .  Many of the actions performed by many women ,  according to the misogynists he likes to write about ,  are performed by many men ,  and many ugly people would appear to be just as happy ,  and just as emotionally fulfilled ,  as many lovely ones .  Amis also likes to write , as Larkin liked to write , about the fear of death , and it may be that this fear can be detected in the failure to notice here that both <head>sorts</head> of people are subject to it , as to other unavoidable misfortunes , and that both sorts die . Amis and Larkin are the same but different .  The poem and novel I have attributed to them respectively can also ,  for certain purposes ,  be attributed to them both .

The second sentence of the issue of May 1988 refers to the first twenty years of the state :  Threatening to push the Jews into the sea ,  the Arab world reformulated the Nazi theory of Lebensraum  in Mediterranean terms :  there was no room in the region for a Jewish homeland .  Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .  This is reminiscent of the <head>sort</head> of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can produce which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary .

George Schultz travelled to the Middle East in the summer of 1988 to spread the word that the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead - end street .

Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,  and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work .  Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar <head>sort</head> of schedule , which means agents are asked to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools ,  and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .  Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .

The scepticism follows because if we are confined in experience to the contents of our own minds alone ,  it would seem to be impossible that we should ever come to know anything about  or even come intelligibly to think about  things outside our own minds .  The programme of many modern philosophers ,  therefore ,  has been to develop a conception of man and his mind which either disposes of or downgrades the inner ,  private arena ,  making the function of mind essentially a part of the public and physical world .  Once this is achieved and this , it is held , can be done by some <head>sort</head> of physicalist theory of mind with strong behaviourist elements then most of the insoluble problems of early modern philosophy disappear . I want to defend a radically different picture ,  which takes a much  broader historical perspective .  This alternative picture involves denying that there is a coherent materialist alternative to the Cartesian private theatre view of the mind ;  but it also involves placing the attack on the Cartesian picture in a wider context .

From the point of view of the experiencing subject ,  the meaningfulness is not something of which he is conscious ;  all he experiences is ,  first the word red ,  then a mental image :  there is nothing that could count as his internally and introspectably associating them which does not reintroduce the mysterious generality of thought .  It does not help the associationist to press the concept of resemblance to his aid .  It might seem that it would , because it might seem very natural to think that one red thing or image might be taken as standing for red things in general because of its natural resemblance to the other members of the class , this constituting the most fundamental <head>sort</head> of association . But resemblance cannot explain how a thinker could experience one object as standing for another ;  for how could the fact that a particular  datum is similar to other things mean anything to a thinker unless he experienced it as  being like many others  that is ,  unless he grasped it ,  not just as a particular but as  an instance of a kind ?  But this is the very ability for which we are trying to account .

So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this argument is to  deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know .  All that BS lacks is an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain <head>sorts</head> : V knows no more than BS , he can simply do something BS cannot . BS is like a man who knows all about swimming ,  even to the point of being able to train the Olympic team ,  but who cannot swim himself ,  and V is the man with the normal talent for swimming .  I think that it would be true to say that ,  nowadays ,  most materialists want to avoid theories that are as nakedly behaviouristic as this ,  and want to accommodate the common - sense intuition that something inner and introspectible is missing in the blind or deaf ,  for example ,  in addition to their lost capacity to respond .

It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a difference if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various <head>sorts</head> of stimuli within the nervous system ? This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .

There is representation in a language but no knowledge ,  and therefore no thought in the human sense .  We should attend to the fact that knowledge of the external world means representing a lot of facts at once ,  so many facts that we lose hold of the idea of representation .

What Peter had damaged ,  and what one might hope to restore ,  was the natural soil - based unity of Russia .  And so ,  as in Winter Notes  ,  Dostoevsky is really talking about pochvennost  ,  his own brand of romantic conservatism ,  half history ,  half dream .  In Crime and Punishment itself the Petrine reforms get the merest glancing reference , and only one , when Raskolnikov 's friend Razumikhin speaks of us ( compare the we of the Drunks fragment ) as divorced from practical affairs of every <head>sort</head> for nearly two hundred years .

The truth is ,  not all exciting stories are properly thrillers .  Being gripped by a narrative is an altogether wider notion than what is presaged by the two - in - one of being outside yet inside Raskolnikov 's  strange smile :  the rehearsal of the murder ,  the murder sequence itself ,  the three long duels with the detective Porfiry ,  the suffering ,  the hesitation ,  the final climb up the police - station stairs .  Dostoevsky 's own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows : Narration by the author , a <head>sort</head> of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So ,  after appearing to settle for third - person narrative ,  he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist .  That he succeeds in having it both ways is our experience of reading his novel in its dominant and thriller aspect .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public image is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong <head>sort</head> of publicity .

Hatred of Jews is something that the Fascist is especially prone to ,  but it is n't a necessary consequence of his Fascism ,  and in any case it 's  only a symptom ,  certainly not the root cause of his disease .  ( In Italian Fascism it showed up only quite late ,  as Giorgio Bassani may remind us .  )  When we denounce the anti - Semitism and let the Fascism take care of itself , we are fastening on what is prepolitical or sub - political , and refusing to engage ourselves on the plane of politics where , as Olson insists , we 're required to vindicate our own <head>sorts</head> of polity against the Fascist sorts . What we gain from this is obvious :  our own consciences are clear ,  and we 're no longer implicated .  Or if we are implicated a little  ( since doubtless some Gentiles and even some Jews have anti - Jewish feelings that they 're ashamed of )  ,  the implication I would guess is altogether more manageable than what happens when  Jew and Gentile alike ,  black as well as white  the educated elite is forced to confront its feelings about the Masses .

and fall into those flowers and sink into the marsh near them .  This must be the <head>sort</head> of writing that Crane had in mind when he applauded Williams ( still rather grudgingly , however ) for sometimes attaining the classic manner of the old Chinese poets . Certainly the deliberate navet here is not in the least false ,  but has the limpid directness of some of the Chinese poems that Pound had marvellously transfigured in Cathay   ( 1915 )  .

Certainly the aspiration is not limited in modern times to those who have read Emaux et Cames  ,  the French book that Pound respectfully pillaged for Hugh Selwyn Mauberley  ;  it is to be found in all modern poetries known to me ,  Russian and Polish as well as French ,  and  ( more faintly )  in British and American .  In short ,  what this has to do with modern poetry is very clear ;  what it has to do with modern criticism is not clear at all ,  since that criticism has ,  as we have seen ,  no vocabulary for dealing with it ,  and moves further and further from finding such a vocabulary ,  the more it takes its lead from linguisticians like Saussure and Jakobson .  After he has made his first claim for Landor , Pound writes two paragraphs of the <head>sort</head> that have provoked near - apoplexy , because they have not been taken in the spirit that Pound intended : We have in English a certain gamut of styles :  we have the good Chaucerian ;  almost the only style in English where softness is tolerable ;  we have the good Elizabethan ;  and the bad ,  or muzzy ,  Elizabethan ;  and the Miltonic ,  which is a bombastic and rhetorical Elizabethan coming from an attempt to write English with Latin syntax .

Foreign affairs are not often an important factor in British general elections .  But the rapid and dramatic changes which are taking place in the world today ,  changes of a hopeful and not a frightening kind ,  could help to make a long - serving government more vulnerable to the time - for - a - change mentality .

The French team have been together since Sunday  and even that was not enough for Fouroux .  He wanted them to gather last Friday and be absented from their weekend round of Championship matches ,  but even Albert Ferrasse ,  the autocratic French Federation president ,  would not stand for that .  In fact it worked out well for Fouroux , since most of his players ran into the <head>sort</head> of form which , if reproduced tonight , will make the Home Union 's players wish they were just that at home . Philippe Sella ,  for instance ,  scored three tries for Agen against Ussel ,  and his co - centre Marc Andrieu two for Nimes against Lavelanet .  Unfortunately for the Lions ,  as the French persist in calling them ,  they will have had nothing like the preparation time of their opponents .

The topics include the first design ,  the sculptor 's  aims ,  the carving of the work ,  the memorial 's  defenders and attackers ,  and a final general reflection on the standing of great art and how it is likely to provoke opposition .  The monograph is accompanied by a facsimile of a sketchbook for the memorial , and documented by letters and printed <head>sources</head> , including articles in the press . the art criticism of the day is fully described in the monograph ,  and some of the underlying reasons for its mainly aggressive character are outlined ;  these include anti - Semitism and the fierce dislike of the monument by some academic sculptors .  A guide to London public sculpture described the monument as A masterpiece by the much - advertised apostle of Ugliness ,  a view shared by those who felt that Hudson the nature lover was ill commemorated by a sculpture which showed nature in so raw a state .

The most common sort of mixed exhibition is the exhibiting society ,  whose history is entwined with the development of art in Europe since the eighteenth century .

The second half of this can be seen to coincide with the opinion of Chatterton which is expressed by Ackroyd 's  Wilde :  a strange ,  slight boy who was so prodigal of his genius that he attached the names of others to it .  Peter Ackroyd has here performed the not impossible feat of plagiarising himself  while leaving the reader in doubt as to whether the writer shares this implausible estimate of Chatterton 's  marvellous buoyancy .  As Ackroyd 's ventriloquised Wilde makes clear , Wilde was a great exaggerator and , like his friend Whitman , a great contradictor of himself ; and he is certainly a great <head>source</head> of dualistic formulations , in all their slippery bliss . He is the artist 's  friend ,  and a friend of the mimic and poseur ,  in a world of masks ,  multiplicities ,  contraries and successive interpretations .

However ,  in the interests of Western European stability and its own financial position ,  the British government is perhaps still putting off the final offer  either British withdrawal or some form of power - sharing with catholic nationalists  in the hope of loyalists coming round to what is seen as a more reasonable position .  The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course , with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies , additional <head>sources</head> of power have been brought into play . But it is likely that the professionals who have been responsible for the running of such companies at local level will have been allied to the more liberal group among the upper protestant classes ,  as represented by such families as the O'Neills ,  who have looked to the English public schools for the right sort of education .  Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .

This form of political violence requires political answers and not just an anti - criminal ,  police - oriented ,  coercive response .  But also because such violence can have some hegemonic justification  derived in Ireland from the threat of the alternative alliance  the beliefs too must be scrutinized for their contribution ,  religious beliefs as well .   We can look at the twin <head>sources</head> for the state 's legitimacy in the context of the Republic of Ireland . First there is the fact of statehood ,  with the implied acceptance of law and order by the people .  Second ,  there is the unifying dominant beliefs of Irish catholic nationalism .

Secondly ,  and in contrast with this respect for the state 's  monopoly of violence ,  because the provisionals seek to destroy the Northern dominance of protestant loyalists with a view to restoring the historic integrity of Ireland ,  there is and will remain substantial support from among the Southern population for the violence the provisionals actually commit in the North .  The belief in the integrity of Ireland is central to the unifying dominant beliefs of the alliance and is clearly distinct from the specificity of statehood .  The dual <head>source</head> of the state 's role in hegemony helps us understand the limitations of the state in respect of the alliance whose power it also represents . This is why collections by the provisionals in public houses were having partial success in the  1970s without too much interference by the Garda ,  the Republic 's  police force .  The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity ,  in addition to the much smaller party political support they enjoyed in the South .

One could try to approach it with the notion of spheres of competence .

The source of energy for a muscle contraction is Adenosine Triphosphate  ( A.T.P .  )  and this occurs in very small amounts in human muscle .  Therefore ,  it needs to be rapidly regenerated if exercise is to continue ,  and this regeneration is brought about by a substance called Creatine Phosphate  ( C.P. )  .  The splitting of the A.T.P . and C.P. molecules is the prime <head>source</head> of muscular energy . These processes are anaerobic  ( without oxygen )  and no lactic acid is formed in the muscles .

After this the energy is supplied by the breakdown of muscle glycogen into lactic acid .  Glycogen is produced from complex carbohydrate ,  and therefore the energy required for training is ultimately derived from the complex carbohydrates you eat .  It is possible to break down fat to use as energy when you are training , but it is essentially glycogen which is the energy <head>source</head> . In order to ensure that enough glycogen is present for training ,  carbohydrates should make up approximately half of your daily diet .

Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .  A fresh <head>source</head> of glycogen is then needed to restore the muscles to their original size and to encourage growth of the muscle tissue . Therefore ,  complex carbohydrates are initially more important after a work - out than protein .  Complex carbohydrates are best taken regularly throughout the day so that the glycogen is steadily replaced and built up in the muscles .

Not only does seeing a chair as a three - dimensional object have this character ,  but so does seeing one line as longer in the Mulier - Lyer illusion  ( in which two lines of equal length look unequal when differently slanting lines are drawn at the tips )  despite our knowing that the two lines are really the same length .

By CLARE DOBIE ,  Deputy City Editor SHARES in James Neill ,  the Sheffield engineer ,  were suspended yesterday at 202p ,  valuing the company at 140.2m ,  prompting speculation that an agreed bid will be launched today .  The shares were <head>suspended</head> at the company 's request after James Wilkes , the beer mat maker also based in Sheffield , sold its 9.6 per cent stake in Neill . According to Stephen Hinchliffe ,  Wilkes '  chairman ,  it sold the shares for substantially more than 202p .  This suggests that any bid would be pitched well above the suspension price .

They went on to finish third in the finals in West Germany .  Now ,  their main hopes rest on the striker Dariusz Dziekanowski ,  a deep disappointment to his countrymen when Poland lost to Gary Lineker 's  hat - trick in Monterey in 1986 but lately revived by a transfer to Celtic ,  for whom he vainly scored four goals in that extraordinary roller - coaster of a European tie against Partizan Belgrade at Parkhead 13 days ago. Dziekanowski did not play at Wembley last summer he was <head>suspended</head> after walking out on his then club Legia Warsaw but clearly he is in the mood to test the English defenders whom Bobby Robson has been casting as his unsung heroes . The new Polish manager ,  Andrzej Strejau ,  has said he noted faults in Terry Butcher 's  game during the goalless draw in Sweden last month .  But England feel that the pace of Des Walker ,  the great gain of last season 's  unbeaten sequence ,  should close any gaps .

There is the Crook Town Affair of 1928 , when 350 amateurs were <head>suspended</head> for accepting excessive tea money ; West Auckland 's World Cup triumphs in Italy in 1909 and 1911 ; the origins of Brian Clough 's first club , Billingham Synthonia ( named after an agricultural fertiliser ! ) ; and the brief flowering of the wonderfully named Thornaby Utopians . Part of the modern football experience is the rush of excitement when the local pink or green sports final arrives .

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .

Mr Badran ,  who was seeking a vote of confidence from the newly elected parliament ,  said :  I announce that martial law is now considered frozen until such laws are constitutionally abolished in the near future .

Almost all candidates in last month 's  general elections ,  which were also the first in more than 22 years ,  called for lifting of martial law and defence laws and demanded the freedom of the press ,  freedom of association ,  and the legalisation of political parties banned by law since 1957 .

The second field of investigation was mesmerism .  Sleep had always been regarded as being in some way analogous to death ;  the hypnotic trance was seen as having aspects of both conditions .  If , under its influence , normal physical functions could be <head>suspended</head> , perhaps the hand of death , too , could be stayed . This was the theme ingeniously exploited by Poe in his tale ,  The Facts in the Case of   M. Valdemar  ,  in which a semblance of life was related as having been preserved in a man mesmerised when at the point of death .  The story ,  published in the USA in 1845 ,  was reprinted in England as a pamphlet with the title ,  Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis  ,  and was widely held to be an account of a real experiment .

The nylon stocking was still <head>suspended</head> from a constricting girdle of unyielding firmness , a fortification virtually impossible to bypass without active collusion , and preferably plenty of time . Unpremeditated impulses were often frustrated by such hurdles .  The frustrated resorted to petting as a substitute .

There was talk of developing a clean bomb with little fall - out ,  a chimera at that time ,  which simply produced a lot of Carbon - 14 which does not decay for literally thousands of years .  But by August 1958 both sides realized that world opinion was turning against them ,  partly as a result of the scientists '  warnings ,  partly out of revulsion and fear ,  partly because nuclear disarmament had begun to be a popular political issue  and nothing makes a politician have second thoughts faster than the awareness that he might be losing votes .  So , after that year 's very comprehensive tests were finished , Eisenhower announced he would <head>suspend</head> American tests for a year , with extensions if the Russians and the British followed suit . The pause was to last for three years .  It was not as altruistic as it may have looked .

Frankie was an expert .  He hoisted the rope to the very top of the hill ,  leaped into space with his bare feet wedged against the big knot and soared like an eagle over the tree tops .  At its farthest point , that spot where he hovered high in the air before the rope changed direction , he knew that he was <head>suspended</head> sixty feet above Mucky Beck and the perimeter wall . The danger of killing himself in a fall was very real ,  but this was a fear he had learned to master ,  even to enjoy .  It was the unseen  ,  the quiet menace  that defeated him.

In this cloudy world ,  where so little seemed dependable or real ,  moral values were frequently suspended too .  This chapter investigates how that world appeared to the players and the lookers on ,  both at the time and afterwards .

Letter to the Editor :  Treaty sell - out SIR  Since Peterborough reported that the Maastricht Treaty was being sold by HMSO  ( March 19 )  I have been trying to obtain a copy without success .  HMSO says all copies have been sold and no more will be available as publication has been <head>suspended</head> on instructions from the EC . If the Danish Government was able to distribute 300,000 copies of the Maastricht text through newsagents and libraries ,  who has decided here ,  or in Brussels ,  that the British public should not be allowed to find out for themselves during the election what the small print of the treaty contains ?  If ,  as Lord Bruce of Donington points out  ( letter ,  April 2 )  ,  the new Parliament will be presented with a Bill before most members have themselves been able to read the text of the treaty ,  this is presumably in the hope that they will railroad it through before the British presidency commences in June.

Owen Teale 's  comic and original Hotspur brings much more to the part than the usual hellcat warrior .  Sylvestra le Touzel ,  his forbidding English wife ,  is in stark contrast to the Celtic sexiness of Lady Mortimer  ( Jane Gurnett )  ,  who gabbles away in Welsh under the paternal gaze of Bernard Kaye 's  Glendower ,  the crashing bore .  With a shrine <head>suspended</head> from the ceiling and with Jerusalem evoked in Henry 's opening speech , the guilty spiritual stain of Henry 's usurpation certainly makes itself felt amid the play 's comic carry - ons and pisspot humour . It is the sense of an England bloodily engaged in bashing out a national destiny from the tribal chaos which is best conveyed in this rich ,  poetic panorama .  It leaves you eager for the sequel .

He was <head>suspended</head> for two years after he tested positive for drugs when finishing second in the 1988 New York race .

James S.

We can return for a moment to <head>talk</head> to the girl who went to Italy , and was overwhelmed by Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel ceiling .

Any time that a wing begins to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin ,  but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw .  In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and  remember .  It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only <head>talk</head> about stalls and spins . Although it is obviously accurate to call an incipient spin a stall with a wing - drop ,  I think that this is trying to avoid the issue ,  which is that it is really the beginning of a spin and at least a potential spin .

Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .  This was especially true of the Fire Service , our immediate neighbours , and it applied equally to those in the adjacent Gateshead Borough Police and Northumberland Constabulary , who were always <head>talked</head> of as being a lesser breed of mortals . This characteristic supports Peter Evans  ( 1977 )  ,  then The Times 's   Home Affairs correspondent ,  who described the police as being peculiarly tribal by nature .  In the small forces of the late 1950s these separations were made much of ,  with those in the adjacent forces essentially seen as belonging to another tribe .

Studs had been Dionne 's  last Big Romance .  She 'd moved in on and in with Dionne ,  spitting scorn at her friends ,  slurring drunk at parties .  Jamie called her Ug the Cavewoman , Francis had tried <head>talking</head> with her on many occasions : Only I do find monosyllables wearing ,  dear !  Dionne went for the outlaw type ,  or so she said ,  then mothered and civilised them until they were unrecognisable ,  and when her dream of civilised and raunchy equality went out the slammed door ,  there she was alone again ,  smoking a little more than usual ,  drinking a little more than necessary and swearing herself to celibacy until the next sulky brow slouched into view and stole her hopeful heart away .

It looks silly from the perspective of our so - called folk psychology of thinking .  For ,  paradoxically enough ,  it is the language of thought thesis which is closer to the layman 's  intuitions about thinking .  We have a way of <head>talking</head> , and thus a way of thinking , about thoughts as if they were sentences in the head ; and it is worth noting that Fodor ( for example in Psychosemantics ) regards folk psychology as providing a rough but reliable account of mental life and behaviour . The doctrine of holism ,  by contrast ,  challenges our folk psychology of thought  ( see Note 1 )  .  How ,  then ,  might a supporter of the mental sentence view try to deal with the holism of the mental ?

Of his attempts to realize this experience over again in his post - Siberian fiction ,  the bald Epilogue to Crime and Punishment  is an early and unpromising instance .  We have here perhaps the most delicate of all points of contact between his life and his art :  hence the impression that further and very private issues are involved in ,  even shielded by ,  the assertion that a man of the 1840s could not create Bazarov .  As I suggested apropos the Petrashevsky Circle , one feels an urge to smoke Dostoevsky out with the question , who 's <head>talking</head> ? The epileptic makes a neat reply ,  again touching life and art simultaneously :  the author and hero of The Idiot  .

When this and the regeneration/resurrection theme are brought to bear upon the remark about Bazarov and the 1840s ,  what seemed a difference of degree turns out to be one of a kind .  The criticism of Turgenev is only incidentally that he is stuck in the 1840s and not far - sighted enough .  New - sightedness , the timeless standpoint , hitherto unknown reality these have an air of mystical hubris when dragged into the open , but they are what Dostoevsky is really <head>talking</head> about . And so while he sat in a German public library and the story of the murder in the park unfolded before him in the newspapers ,  a novel began to stir .  Or ,  in mystic vein ,  an order of being was glimpsed in which the 1840s ,  the 1860s ,  nihilism ,  Bazarov ,  found themselves apocalyptically and teleologically disposed  those two polysyllabic adverbs embracing and transcended all nature ,  including futurity .

As it is ,  he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that important work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel ,  like the Russians ,  the Germans ,  the Americans ,  who ,  poor dears ,  know no better .  The great cultural danger for the English is ,  to my mind ,  their tendency to judge the arts by the values appropriate to the conduct of family life .  Among brothers and sisters it is becoming to entertain each other with witty remarks , hoaxes , family games and jokes , unbecoming to be solemn , to monopolize the conversation , to <head>talk</head> shop , to create emotional scenes . But no art ,  major or minor ,  can be governed by the rules of social amenity .  The English have a greater talent than any other people for creating an agreeable family life ;  that is why it is such a threat to their artistic and intellectual life .

And once again it was this unrelenting professionalism in Pound that set ,  and continues to set ,  Englishmen 's  teeth on edge .  For in our national tradition ,  in the arts as until recently in sports ,  it is the amateur who is most admired ;  and Auden 's  charming joker by the Christmas hearth is only a particular version of the amateur .  He observes the prohibition against talking shop , whereas Pound through his London years seems never to have <head>talked</head> anything else . ( Once again Eliot knew ,  or soon learned ,  better .  )  And the most Anglophobe of Pound 's  books is ,  appropriately ,  the one that is most full of shoptalk  though of shoptalk of a special kind ,  the talk of the master to his apprentices in the shop that is a workshop ,  the atelier  where the talk that goes on is the vehicle by which an artistic tradition is transmitted ,  not in conceptualizing ,  and tendentious readings of history ,  but where it is concrete  ,  in tricks of the trade and rules of thumb and words to the wise .

No ,  Professor X ,  Pound does not  say that Landor ,  or Landor at his best ,  is better than Keats ;  and no ,  sir ,  he does not  say that Chaucer is better than Milton .  He is concerned with the Miltonic ,  with Miltonism ,  not with Keats but with  bad  Keats ,  not with Browning but with Browningese .  He is not <head>talking</head> about any one of these great writers ( his devotion to Browning was well advertised ) but about , in Eliot 's words , the pernicious or merely deadening influence that a great writer can have , at a particular time . A great writer 's  idiom is ,  by himself when he nods and more certainly by his epigones who emulate and copy him ,  rigidified and adulterated .  And the more idiosyncratic his genius  ( this is the case of Milton ,  surely )  ,  the more likely it is that what will be copied is his mannerisms .

From ROBERT FISK in Taif ,  Saudi Arabia A CONVOY of black limousines conveyed the 31 Lebanese Muslim MPs in Saudi Arabia on an extra - parliamentary pilgrimage to Mecca yesterday afternoon ,  leaving their 31 Christian colleagues behind in Taif to ruminate on how best they might protect Christian political power in a new Lebanon .  No - one is yet <head>talking</head> about a new Lebanon but there is now widespread acceptance among both Muslims and Christians in the Lebanese parliament that the country 's unwritten national covenant is now obsolete .

Already ,  however ,  a committee of assembly members  -  among them only one Maronite  has been instructed to draw up a report ,  once the debates are over ,  on the changes in the covenant which a majority of parliamentarians will accept .

Portnoy 's  Complaint  is a work of the furious imagination spoken of ,  and rendered debatable ,  in The Facts  .  It is seen in The Facts  to belong to the times in which the writer lived when he wrote the novel ,  when opposition to the Vietnam War ,  and to a President Johnson perceived as monstrous ,  took to the street - wisdom of a farcical obscenity .  The Facts is able to <head>treat</head> the historical conditioning of Portnoy 's Complaint in a way in which the novel itself was not in a position to do . It has the  benefit of hindsight .  But it would also appear to know its own place in history in a way which an exercise of the furious imagination in art can sometimes seem to prevent .

CAMRA is also concerned at the way in which many keg beers are brewed and the ingredients used .  Mashing ,  boiling and fermentation are often speeded up in large breweries using such devices as continuous fermentation and high gravity brewing ,  both of which produce standardised bland beers of mediocre quality .  In order to further speed and cheapen the process , inferior ingredients such as maize , rice , triticale , wheat flour and potato starch are used and helped on their way by chemicals that hasten fermentation , cut down on the yeast head in the vessels to allow more wort to be <head>treated</head> , and to give a lively fake head to the finished product . Beer is classified as a food stuff and yet it is excluded from the legal requirements to list ingredients .  Drinkers have a right to know whether the beer they are drinking is a genuine barley malt product or whether it is stuffed full of such tasty ingredients as corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  amyloglucosidase ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .

My becoming homeless was not a result of my dropping out of a system which probably would have supported me until retirement age ;  it was the result of a chain of events which took place much ,  much later .  Blame me for becoming poor if you like I admit , I blew it but the responsibility for the way our society <head>treats</head> its poorer members is not exclusively mine . One immediate result of my departure from Berkeley was my giving up my flat by the school and going back to London .

If the glider gets wet before taking off for a high climb ,  the airbrakes may freeze up and become unusable .

Modern machines are blessed with a minimum of tail area and even a small coating on the leading edge of the tailplane may cause uncontrollable stability problems .  Probably for this reason most of the glass fibre gliders are not cleared by the manufacturers for cloud flying .

The case of Virgil is a crucial one For anyone for whom literary education  like any other  is an exploration of the meanings we have and live by ,  so far as we do live by meanings ,  Virgil and Dante are connecting rooms To talk of getting the full charge of the Divine Comedy or more modestly and exactly , the fullest charge the particular reader is capable of getting while <head>treating</head> Dante 's master as an irrelevance , is nonsense ; This is part of a polemic  ( reluctant ,  because in other contexts and on other grounds Sisson venerates Pound )  against Ezra Pound 's  treatment of Virgil :   there are such absurdities in Pound as the assertion that Gavin Douglas 's  excellent Aeneidos  is better than the original ,  together with other devaluings of Virgil '  For Eliot and Sisson it is unthinkable that one can venerate Dante without venerating Virgil ,  and vice - versa  ;  whereas Pound was firmly pro - Dante ,  and yet often raucously dismissive of Virgil .

One feature of English verse that is scanted by this method ,  or can be acknowledged only incidentally ,  is one that every careful reader knows from his or her experience :  tempo  ,  the speeding up or slowing down of enunciation ,  and therefore of apprehension ,  as we read through a line or through several lines in sequence .  This seems to be intimately connected with another principle ,  which is more radical and therefore more important :  that of quantity  ,  of syllables as being ,  in relation to their contiguous syllables ,  either long or short .  The variation between English - language speakers about what syllables , in effect what vowels , they <head>treat</head> as long or short , is so great that there can be no question of imposing on English verse a quantitative metre such as was used for ancient Latin ( doubtless with some strain for those who spoke classical Latin with dialectal variations as to quantity ) . This granted ,  it remains true ,  as anyone 's  experience of his own and others '  speech - habits will confirm ,  that some English vowels are experienced and expressed as relatively long ,  others as relatively short .  Not just unmetrical poets like Pound  ( for the most part )  and Bunting ,  but also a strictly metrical poet like the later Yvor Winters ,  came to think that the finest auditory effects in English - language verse were attained by those poets who attended to the quantitative elements in British or American speech as an incalculable dimension super - added to the recognized and calculable dimensions of syllable - count and stresscount .

The GDR 's  acceptance as a real country has been the function of the Cold War ,  a piece of make - believe reflecting tacit agreement by both blocs that the German Question is best put on hold .

The two men were held in military custody , incommunicado , for some time and are believed to have been ill - <head>treated</head> . Visitors report seeing Mr Nugroho covered in bruises and unable to speak .  Accounts of their trial suggest that it took the form of a political witch - hunt ,  with the intention of intimidating other critics of the government .

The row erupted on Tuesday when it was discovered that ,  by a quirk of the rulebook ,  Mr Le Pen 's  neo - fascists would chair the assembly 's  permanent delegations to Switzerland and Israel .  Mortified ,  all the other political leaders voted to change the rules to exclude the far - right MEPs from their new posts ,  especially after it was discovered that Mr Le Pen 's  man for Israel was likely to be from West Germany 's  Republicans ,  led by an ex - SS officer ,  Franz Schonhuber .  Mr Le Pen launched a tirade of Nazi terminology , suggesting that his MEPs were being <head>treated</head> as Untermenschen . When the ruling was announced yesterday ,  Bruno Gollnisch ,  a European Right MEP ,  shouted Dictator ,  dictator at the Parliament 's  president ,  Enrique Baron ,  and called other MEPs Gestapo men .

AN ACID house fan died when she collapsed in a fit and suffered liver failure after taking a single ecstasy tablet ,  an inquest was told yesterday .  Collette Margaret McCarthy ,  21 ,  a receptionist ,  never recovered consciousness and ,  despite a liver transplant ,  died on 16 August ,  16 days after taking the amphetamine - based hallucinogen ,  Southwark Coroner 's  Court in south London was told .  After the hearing , Dr Bernard Portmann , a pathologist from King 's College Hospital , where Ms McCarthy was <head>treated</head> , said the case was highly unusual . Liver failure was not normally associated with amphetamines ,  which could induce fits and coma ,  he said .  The death suggested a possible previously unrecognised side - effect of ecstasy .

Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .  This not only affects how the male public react to policewomen in the province , it also influences how male colleagues <head>treat</head> policewomen in the work environment and the sorts of duties they are assigned in practice ; and the dearth of senior female officers makes it easy for male colleagues to impose such limits on the role of policewomen . The focus here will be on the way gender structures routine police duties ,  with more general issues concerning women in the RUC being developed elsewhere .   The view is widespread among the senior officers we talked to ,  and among ordinary policemen ,  that policewomen ,  as women ,  have instincts and capabilities which make them better suited to specific types of police work .

It was their first baby ,  tao .

Primarily what makes this type of work unpopular is the ever - present danger that work of this sort will break the veneer of coldness ,  exposing them as emotionally involved ,  which is something they dislike because it is considered unprofessional .  A third type of work which is disliked is work that risks displaying incompetence .

The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .  Where it is seen by work colleagues to be getting out of kilter ,  informal controls can be used to restore equilibrium .  Thus , some policemen are urged by their tough - minded colleagues to <head>treat</head> marginal incidents as criminal behaviour and are encouraged into action . The reverse is equally evident ,  for informal controls sometimes operate to moderate the actions of those members of the RUC who see themselves as Rambo in police uniform .  The satirical phrase used to embarrass the Action Men is that they have the John Wayne syndrome ;  the fact it is Wayne rather than Rambo who is used to ridicule them gives a clue that it tends to be the older members of the force who use the term to describe the exuberant younger policemen .

It was the result of efforts to transfer product systematically from developed to less developed economies ,  while at the same time retaining the essentially American management style of strong planning ,  coordination and control from the centre .  What Bartlett and Ghoshal refer to as the global company is alleged to be the result of Japanese practice developed in the 1960s and 1970s .  Lower trade barriers permitted their development , and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that <head>treated</head> markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale . According to Bartlett and Ghoshal ,  the transnational company is meant to be the vehicle for international marketing of the 1990s that integrates the strengths of the three former culturally - dependent types of company .  To some extent the difference between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics :  the term global company does not mean the same to each .

No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very different ways .

Art history without names was a phrase <head>used</head> by Heinrich Wlflinn , in his introduction to The Principles of Art History first published in 1915 . Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .

This extended critical evaluation is a rarity in a survey ,  but very welcome in the way it spells out a connoisseur 's  response in formal terms to a work of art .  It has the added value of being firmly rooted in a thorough understanding of technique .  Surveys of painting , it has to be admitted , are more fallible in this respect , partly because of the relative simplicity of the means <head>used</head> . Differences exist between the media of tempera and oil ,  or oil and acrylic ,  but they do not have the importance of contrasts in other material processes .  Nevertheless ,  there is one group of surveys of painting which have a special interest :  those which form part of handbooks or ,  more grandly ,  treatises on how to paint .

Only dealers sell on the steps ,  while private owners prefer the more certain floor of a landing of clearly established prices for a category of work .  Correct descriptions are important to auctioneers ,  as can be exemplified by the coding used to list paintings .  This is the system <head>used</head> by Sothebys : ( a )  references to signatures ,  inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist 's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .  Such caution is prudent in a business where errors of judgement can be extremely expensive ;  at least the reader of an auction catalogue knows clearly what view has been taken by the cataloguer on a number of questions .

I was curious to see what shrift she would receive in Naipaul 's  novel :  the work of a man who has been spoken of by an old friend ,  the novelist Paul Theroux ,  as having in earlier times been merciless ,  solitary ,  and  ( one of his favourite words )  unassailable .

Jane is unlikely to earn much sympathy by virtue of the attention given to the environment which produced her dabbling in eventfulness and her poor kiss ,  and yet the two environments have more in common than would once have been thought possible .  It is a quite Caribbean Britain that has made her : a Britain at the end of the world which it <head>used</head> to rule. Ahmed 's  revulsion from Jane sometimes seems to be shared by the writer .  It is possible to think that this plebeian has been lent some part of Naipaul 's  aristocratic fastidiousness ,  some part of his hostility ,  while also suffering the consequences of an exposure to these qualities ,  and to recall that both Ahmed and the author of An Area of Darkness  are preoccupied with the hanks of human shit that litter certain landscapes .

They say she 's  wild after him. She goes every evening to the post ,  and they began to laugh again at what they saw as a mocking mirror of their own flowering .  Moran took the small blue Ford out of the shed after Mass on Sunday , tested the engine and tyres , then <head>washed</head> the car down , dried it and waxed it till it shone . At three o'clock he drove the four miles to Rose Brady 's  house .  The lane into the house was narrow and winding with too many gates so he parked the car on the wide grass margin beside the platform for the creamery cans .

Amid it all was their constant awareness of Moran 's  watching presence ,  sharpening everything they did with the danger of letting something fall and break and bring the weight of his disapproval into the small chain .  All their movements were based more on habit and instinct and fear than any real threat but none the less it was an actual physical state .  They would <head>wash</head> up the same way even if they were not watched . As looking down from great heights brings the urge to fall and end the terror of falling ,  so his very watching put pressure on them to make a slip as they dried and stacked the plates and cups .  There were several alarms ,  bringing laughing giggles of relief when they came to nothing .

The National Association of Specialisht Anglers member put in a couple of days on the River Swale at Topcliffe in North Yorkshire to take six chub over 4 lb ,  including specimens of 5 lb 13 oz and 5 lb 12 oz. The river had been ten feet up the previous week and I thing the chub had been pushed into the swim ,  said Mick ,  33 .  But it also meant a lot of brances had been <head>washed</head> down and the river has a lot of snags anyway . The line just went solid with the 5 ob 13 oz fish see - sawing around a snag and I was sure the line would go .  A similar thing happened with the 5 lb 12 oz fish but I had luck on my side .

That young girl hardly out of her teens ,  married to an ailing elderly man ,  probably never went out of the house apart from these visits to the hospital .  Being well - off  ( the wife of a restaurant owner )  ,  she had many beautiful saris .  Wearing a different one every time she went out would be only normal , particularly since a sari does not have to be <head>washed</head> as frequently as a dress because it is not worn next to the skin . To get a more general view of how the Health Service departments treat their Asian women patients ,  I asked social workers in different parts of London what their experiences had been in dealing with hospitals ,  Health Visitors and Area Health Authorities .  They told me that there were serious everyday problems which arose because the needs of Asian patients were being ignored .

The Ferguson - developed 4wd system ,  which directs power between the front and rear wheels in a fixed 34/66 per cent ratio ,  is effective and durable but hardly state of the art .  Scouring the dealers in a still slushy Scotland ,  I came across a 1985 B - plate model on offer for 4995 at Alex Ritchie Motors of 43 Nithsdale Street  south of the Clyde in real Taggart country .  The car had been <head>washed</head> but not valeted and its general condition suggested that the 58,160 mileage was genuine something that the decidedly patchy service history was unable to confirm ( the vehicle arrived at Ritchie Motors without a service book ) . No sign of any crash repair damage was evident in the bodywork ,  panel alignment was good and the diamond white paintwork looked blemish - free until closer inspection revealed the truth .  Sales director Sandy Ritchie pointed out the repainted sills ,  which were peppered and chipped when the car was acquired .

Normally ,  you will have an opportunity to look over the machine and to sit in the cockpit beforehand to think about all the knobs and levers .

It is also useful to <head>watch</head> how other pilots handle the glider . If possible ,  get someone else to fly it before you to make quite sure that the ASI is working correctly .  Obtain the approximate stalling speed ,  the normal thermalling speed and a sensible approach speed for the glider type from the   pilot .

There is no doubt the uniform policemen see their one - time associates in the CID as having crossed a divide ,  while the detectives know they have joined a closed and somewhat lite family group ,  whose strengths include the inside support of other members of that society .

Having <head>watched</head> and assessed the track record of some young officer , the middle - ranking detectives will perhaps put him forward as a candidate , and I have watched as potential members were admitted only after a series of phone calls had ensured their acceptability to the department .

I have also had to tell others they are unlikely to get in and then try to explain the politics of the department to them and watch their dismay when they realize that ,  perhaps regardless of merit ,  they do not fit in .

To describe self - governed perceptual sequences ,  Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ;  in doing which we  determine what we see and the order in which we see it  roof ,  front - door ,  top - left - hand window ,  and so forth .  Obviously ,  each kind of experience necessarily contains elements of the other. Thus , there is some degree of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and <head>watch</head> it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example ,  we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions ,  and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof  because that 's  the kind of roof we want to see  when the roof is tiled .  In fact ,  in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory ,  as something we cannot choose or will ,  and the subjective as chosen and willed .

Since females reap substantial protective benefits from associating with alpha males ,  this is perhaps not surprising .  When it came to subordinate males ,  however ,  there was a strong relationship between how nice males had been to infants and how likely they were to be attacked by the female :  nicer males fared better .  In the one - way mirror treatment , when males were unaware they were being <head>watched</head> , they were more aggressive towards infants than in the clear screen treatment and as a result they received a drubbing from the female . The experiment thus suggests that while alpha males can trade on their superior competitive ability to obtain mates ,  subordinates may have to wheedle their way into favour .  Judiciously patting junior on the head when mum is watching may be a useful way of doing it .

Light ,  accurate steering allows you to place the car precisely in a bend ,  and although there is a fair amount of body roll ,  once you 've chosen your cornering line not even bumps half - way through will deflect the faithful AX from its path .

As for the match ,  Rovers conspired to throw a smokescreen of their own around their abilities until they emerged starkly with two clever goals inside three minutes early in the second half to scuttle their scoreless fellow Third Division promotion hopefuls .  First Paul Nixon showed intelligence when he ignored an opportunity to shoot and pulled the ball back instead for the better - placed David Mehew to score and then ,  two minutes later ,  Mehew combined with Devon White before sending over a cross that Gary Penrice ,  a yard out ,  accepted with relish .  Mehew 's contribution probably surprised the scouts , who were almost certainly in Bath to <head>watch</head> Penrice and Nigel Martyn , but it is a fair reflection of his part in pushing Rovers into second place . A prodigious runner ,  Mehew 's  pace and fitness give Rovers the appearance of playing 4 - 4 - 2 and 4 - 3 - 3 at the same time and his willingness to get into the penalty area has brought him four goals already this season .  It has also produced satisfaction for his manager ,  Gerry Francis ,  who rescued Mehew from Bath City 's  reserves two years ago.

A successful team may have to go through a number of fights during the course of a day 's  competition so it is not at all unusual to see teams short - handed through injury in the final stages .  Never be tempted to forfeit the last two bouts of a male team match ,  or the last bout of a female team match if you have already seen your team take the deciding first three/two victories .  Although the opposing team has no chance of <head>winning</head> , any attempt to withdraw your remaining team - member ( s ) may well be rewarded by disqualification of the entire team for bad sportsmanship . Sometimes an event is at first delayed but then things happen fast .  Should this occur ,  a team which is relaxing may find itself out of earshot when their name is called .

Our game really is in danger of dying from too much of it .

And that is before you start taking into consideration commercial endorsements and appearance money which ,  at a conservative guess must add at least another 3040m .

The Martina money machine marches on but at 34 ,  and with career prize money of 16million plus to her name ,  the dollars are n't so important these days. It 's  the titles that matter ,  and Martina ,  with 156 ,  has her fair share of them .  In fact , by <head>winning</head> the Pilkington Glass Ladies ' title in June for the 10th time , she came to within one of Chris Evert 's record of 157 career titles . This latest victory at the sunswept and showery Eastbourne was probably one of her most satisfying ,  not least because she defeated a player in the final who herself ,  did everything but win .  Arantxa Sanchez - Vicario positively demolished her opponents with a ruthlessness reminiscent of Navratilova 's  great rival of the 1980 's  ,  Chris Evert .

Brothers Triumph at Doncaster The fifth event on this year 's  Reebok Grand Prix Circuit at Doncaster turned into a personal triumph for the Ingham family from Heywood ,  Lancs .  Michael , the second of three tennis playing brothers , took the 21 and under title with a powerful 63 63 victory over Graham Hobbs ( Dorset ) : whilst younger brother Craig , fought back from one set down against James Lake ( Lincs ) to <head>win</head> the 12 and under title 46 62 61 . Beating the Ingham family monopoly was Michael Calvert  ( Yorks )  who won the 16 's  title 76 46 75 against a tiring Richard Stamp  ( Lincs )  .  In the girls '  event ,  Catherine Wittenberg  ( Kent )  ,  consolidated her position as leader of the Reebok 12 and under Grand Prix table by reaching the final ,  but missed out on maximum points when she lost to Claire Sewell  ( York )  64 61 .

All these transactions could be declared ultra vires ,  beyond the legal powers of local authorities and therefore invalid ,  if Hammersmith loses .

But , if Hammersmith <head>wins</head> and the deals are declared legal , the council will have to pay the losses on the transactions . These have mounted because in February Nicholas Ridley ,  then Secretary of State for the Environment ,  stopped any new deals and Hammersmith 's  portfolio was largely weighted to the expectation that interest rates would be low ,  preventing the council from improving its position in the market .  The council had wound down its holdings from 5bn to 2bn but its advisers had backed the wrong horse by predicting low interest rates .

Books and catalogues may contain criticism ;  but their writers may think of themselves as art historians ,  philosophers ,  aestheticians ,  anthropologists ,  historians or biographers ,  and there are many other possibilities ;  their books may never be identified as art criticism .  As the following chapters will show ,  the useful and helpful functions of art criticism will receive preference in the choice of what is quoted or discussed .  Is the text or part of the text <head>written</head> so that a reader will benefit in a future encounter with a work of art ?

ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so simple , as some art historians <head>write</head> well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .

By the 1850s the tradition had declined ,  so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre .  He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,  careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .  Typically , a laudatory essay he <head>wrote</head> was called The Painter of Modern Life on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ; this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life . Guys '  drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News  ,  a very successful venture begun in 1842 ,  the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like  Punch  or Kladderadatsch  .  The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys '  paper :

Between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea ,  dyeing it with an awful but glorious light ,  the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold ,  and bathes like blood .  Along this fiery path and valley ,  the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided ,  lift themselves in dark ,  indefinite ,  fantastic forms ,  each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue , the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night , which gathers cold and low , advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea , its thin mast <head>written</head> upon the sky , in lines of blood I believe ,  if I were reduced to rest Turner 's  immortality upon any single work ,  I should choose this .  Its daring conception ,  ideal in the highest sense of the word ,  is based on the purest truth ,  and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life ,  its colour is almost perfect ,  not one false or morbid hue in any part or line ,  and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition ;  its drawing is as accurate as fearless ;  the ship buoyant ,  bending ,  and full of motion ;  its tones as true as they are wonderful ;  and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power ,  majesty and deathfulness of the open ,  deep ,  illimitable sea .

Alfred Barr ,  the first director of the Museum of Modern Art ,  New York ,  is exemplary .  In 1936 ,  for example ,  the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions ,  on Cubist and Abstract Art  ,  and Fantastic Art ,  Dada ,  Surrealism  .  For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to <head>write</head> a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent interest which human beings have in the fantastic ,  the irrational ,  the spontaneous ,  the marvellous ,  the enigmatic ,  and the dreamlike .

On Dada he wrote :  With robust iconoclastic  humor  the Dadaists mocked what they considered the sorry shams of European culture .  They even attacked art  especially modern art  but while they made fun of the pre - War Cubists ,  Expressionists and futurists ,  they borrowed and transformed many of the principles and techniques of these earlier movements .  Barr , in what used to be a general policy for museum curators , was not <head>writing</head> a passionate defence of the work his museum exhibited . Rather ,  the Museum does not intend to sponsor a particular aspect of modern art ,  but rather to make a report to the public by offering material for study and comparison .  Barr 's  European equivalents flourished in the 1950s rather than the  1930s  Jean Cassou at the Muse d'Art Moderne in Paris ,  Wilhelm Sandberg at the Stedlijk in Amsterdam ,  Pontus Hulten at the Modern Museum in Stockholm and then at the Pompidou Centre in Paris .

My aim was to investigate the symptoms of decay and perhaps to discover in the capriciousness and the return to chaos a law which would vouchsafe one an insight into the intimate workings of art .  This ,  I confess ,  is to me the real aim of art history .  In 1964 Peter Murray <head>wrote</head> an introduction to a new edition , in which he made an observation about the passage on Bernini 's St Teresa , the sculptural group in Rome which is a key work of the Baroque : Bernini is evidently attempting to render something quite transcendental and something which had never been attempted by a sculptor before that date .  Indeed ,  it is possible to argue that St Teresa 's  mystical ecstasies are themselves something entirely new in the spiritual life of Europe

More informal guidance can be found in books with a personal approach ,  in which class the Companion Guide to Rome  by Georgina Masson is exemplary  ( first published in 1965 )  .  There is adequate historical data about the Sistine Chapel ,  but there is also a personal response :  More , probably , has been <head>written</head> about this great hall - like chapel than any other building in the world ; but in fact no description , picture or photograph conveys the impact which it makes . Perhaps the first ,  and in the end the most lasting ,  impression that one carries away ,  is of the contrast between the golden - cream light and space and the exquisite feeling of harmony engendered by the ceiling as opposed to the deep blue darkness and turmoil of the Last Judgment .  Georgina Masson 's  special gift was her ability to disentangle and evoke in Rome three different cities ,  of Classical Antiquity ,  of the Renaissance ,  and of the Baroque .

How beautiful ,  how devoid of everything like the handicraft of art it is  the largeness ,  and yet ingenuity of its effect  the purity of its colour  the truth ,  yet refinement and elegance of the action ,  particularly of the hands  ( in which he particularly excels )  ;  and then ,  a lesson to all high - minded slovens ,  the patient vigilance with which the whole is linked together ,  by touches ,  in some instances small almost as a miniature ,  but like the sparkling of water .  Diaries are perhaps more often a vehicle for complaints .  Here is an American artist <head>writing</head> about his dismay at the work he saw at Paris in 1831 : Although I had been informed that the present French artists were low in merit ,  I did not expect to find them ,  with little exception ,  so totally devoid of it .  I was disgusted in the beginning with their subjects .

On the engraving of the picture made by Gisbert van Geen in 1588 ,  for which Pozzoferrato supplied the ornamental framework and  which Ridolfi reproduced in his biography ,  Tintoretto is described as being seventy years old .  According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga , <head>written</head> in 1622 and published by A. Luzio , in which among others a self - portrait of Tintoretto is offered to him , Pittalunga argues that the Paris picture may have been the one mentioned and which formed part of Rubens 's estate . This sort of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste ,  though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ;  for example ,  Tietze 's  entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it .  The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .

My senses are charred .  I shall feel again as soon as I dare ,  but now I must not. I do n't take the cigarette out of my mouth when I <head>write</head> Deceased across their letters Siegfried ,  I do n't know what you 'll think ,  but I 've been recommended for the MC  and I 've recommended every single NCO who was with me .  I 'm glad of it  for the confidence it will give me at home .

The facilities available for television training differs from school to school ;  filming and television work is expensive to organise ,  and really there is not so much opportunity as one would like to see for students to gain experience in these vital areas .  However ,  where facilities are available for use over short periods of time ,  the rudiments of camera acting are taught in a structured way .  ( Some schools have been able to co - ordinate work with the National Film School , where a script has been <head>written</head> for the personalities in a group and then filmed on location , and this worked effectively . ) But it 's  true to say that most actors feel their drama school training has left them inadequately prepared for working in television and film by the time they graduate .

If an agent is interested in you he may well have useful comments on the photo you send of yourself ,  on your style and how you present yourself .  Remember this will be a professional opinion from someone who is interested in the qualities you now have to offer ,  so bear such comment well in mind .  The drama school will give you some advice on when and where to <head>write</head> to , and how you organise your letters , but outside advice is very important in helping you to see yourself in perspective . Letters and the curriculum vitae Writing letters about yourself is never easy  we tend either to say too much or too little .

If you are fortunate enough to have secured an agent you will have someone with whom you can talk .  Your agent will want you to be working ,  but they cannot perform miracles for you .  It will be up to you to <head>write</head> constantly and make contacts everywhere and you will largely be responsible for yourself . You always have your agent to refer to should anyone make you an offer .  If you have had problems finding an agent ,  you might consider the possibility of applying to join a co - operative where actors work together and run their own agency .

AMANDA Yes .  There 's lots of new plays being <head>written</head> that I look at and say Oh yes there 's lots of opportunities there . I mean ,  Sugar and Spice  for example by Nigel Williams ;  I 'd love to have a go at doing the part of Sharon sometime ,  I think anything that is well written  that 's  important .  A.R.
