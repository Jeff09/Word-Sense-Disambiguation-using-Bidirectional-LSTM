Whatever flickerings of potential this young tyro possesses, they cannot cover up the fact that he is a painter with the imagination of a retarded adolescent; no technical mastery; no intuitive feeling for pictorial space; no sensitivity towards, or grasp of, tradition; and a colour sense rather less than that of Congo, the chimpanzee who was taught (among other things) a crude responsiveness to colour harmonies by Desmond Morris in the late 1950s.
However, potentially educable as a painter Schnabel may or may not be, his work is just not worthy of serious attention by anyone with a developed taste in this particular art form. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]
Readers need also to be wary of the existence of special markets.
The explosive prices for Teddy Bears in the last few years indicate how a [pb] market can be created, in this case by a mix of merit and nostalgia.
What is clearly a dealers' market is often signalled by the invention of a brand name to group together a variety of material, perhaps rather disparate.
Pop <head>Art</head>is an example.

Widening horizons: investing in the arts [/head] [p]
The arts benefit society in two ways.
First, access to the arts is intrinsic to a high quality of life.
Second, the cultural sector &mdash; the arts, crafts, design, and audiovisual industries &mdash; makes as great a net contribution to the economy as does the oil industry.
We will: [list] [item]

It is fair to say that nothing Frank has achieved as a film-maker approaches the heights he scaled with The Americans. [/p] [p]
The 50-minute film he made for Arena suggests why: Last Supper &mdash; Frank on Frank looks like a parody of the excesses of Sixties avant-garde film-making.
On an empty lot between two Harlem streets, a group of people arrive for an outdoor party to celebrate the new publication of an unnamed author.
Initially they make respectful small-talk about him, but their comments grow increasingly resentful as it becomes apparent he will not show up. [/p] [p]

Therefore if we carry ourselves with pride, our self-esteem increases and others will notice. [/p] [p]
If someone does come looking for trouble, he or she will pick a victim who does not look capable of causing any real problem.
We need to make it clear by the way we stand and hold a gaze, and by the way we speak, that we cannot be so easily dismissed.
In fact we have to show that we are prepared, if necessary, to do whatever it takes to survive.
I'm not talking about aggression, but about asserting ourselves &mdash; firmly and resolutely.
We can still give our opponent the chance to back off, we can still use reason, but he or she must realize that the wrong person has been picked for breakfast.

Alfred Reginald Thomson, R.A., R.P., (1894&ndash;1979) &mdash; War Artist [/head] [p]
All branches of the armed services at various times made appointments of official War Artists, who were commissioned to paint battle scenes or portraits for the armed services.
In 1942 one such appointment was made of a deaf artist, Alfred Reginald Thomson, as official War Artist to the Royal Air Force. [/p] [p]
A.R.
Thomson was born in Bangalore, India, in 1894 and was educated at the Royal School for Deaf Children, Margate, in England before he went to study <head>art</head>at the London Art School, Kensington, and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1920.

Most of the teachers in grammar schools were graduates of universities: many, but by no means all of them, had also taken a one-year course of teacher training after completing their undergraduate studies.
The exceptions were the teachers in such subjects as physical education, art, and the crafts.
The domination of the curriculum by subjects classically defined was, indeed, the most obvious feature of the grammar-school curriculum.
That curriculum needed relatively little adjustment across the pre- and post-War years.
The contrast for the eleven-year-old with the more informal and less specialist work of the primary school was sharp and abrupt.
English, mathematics, a foreign language (usually French), Latin (often but not always), the sciences, history, geography, some <head>art</head>and crafts, but not too much, PE and games, the compulsory religious education: these were the invariable components of the first two or three years of a grammar-school education.

I would therefore argue that one of the chief tasks of education, perhaps its overriding task, is the education and encouragement of a child's imagination, so that he may not be a slave to a perception confined solely to the present, a perception that is little more than blindness.
The teaching of history is one part of such an education; the encouragement of creativity is another, and there are others still. [/p] [p]
After primary school, the encouragement of the imagination in children, and the cultivation of specifically creative activities, has often been thought an optional part of the curriculum, a luxury that may have to be dispensed with, left in, if at all, for the less able pupils deemed incapable of serious learning or for that minority determined to reject &bquo;scientific&equo; understanding.
Imagination has been associated especially with the <head>arts</head> , and thus in recent years has been increasingly downgraded.

It was not all going to be wine and roses; [pb] and Leonard again felt the sharp problem of the Canadian writer at that time &mdash; having a small home market, not wishing to become artistically part of the &bquo;53rd State&equo; of America, and yet having nowhere else to go.
As Layton said, &bquo;I still regret that we got no encouragement from the CBC, because I think that we would have gone on to write plays.&equo; [/p] [p]
So it was that they went on to do other things, but separately; a &bquo;beautiful&equo; working relationship was thereby broken up, and two highly creative thinkers had their play-writing ambitions stillborn.
(This was not, in fact, the end of Leonard's ambitions in that regard.
In [hi]Flowers for Hitler [/hi], pp 110ff, he published his &bquo;The New Step&equo;: a ballet-drama in one act; and an involvement in film-making would help to sublimate it, as we shall see.) [/p] [p]

By piercing hundreds of news-cuttings with barbed-wire, Jarman intends his most wounding attack on the tabloids' attitude to homosexuality.

Thus their second section, &bquo;The Idea of Modernity&equo;, includes two sub-sections entitled &bquo;Modernity&equo; and &bquo;Cubism&equo;.
The former has fourteen texts ranging from manifestoes by Malevich and Marinetti to extracts from Bergson, Simmel, Weber and Karl Kraus; the latter has twelve more familiar texts on Cubism.
Later on, issues surrounding Pop Art and post-war abstraction are bracketed together in a section called &bquo;Modernization and Modernism&equo;.

According to Wickramasinghe, xenon at 40 atmospheres should provide a fivefold improvement in resolution over a water-coupled instrument.

Only when they have examined what hands, arms, legs and feet, body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story, theme or music, can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture, with the right quality, mood, emotion, action and character.
The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and, when needed, help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole.
Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story, theme and/or music that they wish to communicate. [/p] [p]

He cuts an enigmatic and sympathetic figure: a recluse who would go around his palace incognito dressed as a groom; a man who had his future foretold by Nostradamus; who employed the English occultists, Dee and Kelley; who dabbled in magic and yet was one of the greatest patrons of the Renaissance in Europe.
He prized the great masters of the high Renaissance, [pb] and collected around himself artists of the calibre of Hans von Aachen, Giuseppe Archimboldo, Josef Heintz and Roelant Savery.
He was advised in the arts by the century's greatest antiquaries, Jacopo Strada and his son, Ottavio.

YOU have to wonder what the Bush administration was looking for when it set out, in early 1989, to find a new chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts.
Knowing what the Bushmen knew then &mdash; that the NEA was unpopular with conservative legislators and already the target of fundamentalist Christians for subsidising offensive <head>art</head>&mdash; they can hardly have seen this as a plum they could hand to a big contributor or a rising political star or, indeed, to anybody aiming to leave town alive.

Consider the Japanese word for the martial arts as a whole: budo.
It means, literally, &bquo;the way to stop the spear&equo;.
Less esoterically, it means &bquo;to stop fighting&equo;, as does the Chinese word for the martial arts, wushu.
The true aim of the martial arts is to avoid conflict; it is best summed up in one commentator's description of aikido as &bquo;the honourable art of getting the hell out of the way&equo;.
The aggression, if there is any, is controlled.
In the eyes of good practitioners self-control allows them to find a path around conflict. [/p] [p]
To some westerners this seems pseudo-philosophical bunkum, but East Asians take it seriously.
Most, if not all, of the martial <head>arts</head>are inextricably linked to the three main East Asian religions, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.

For when it comes it is more violent, more annihilating, more interminable than I can remember it, this feeling in the pit of the stomach, this physical pain and physical desire to retch, to want to get rid of something, of everything, to want to make all that is inside emerge and disappear, drain away, mingle with the rest of the detritus of the world, but it is [hi]not only physical [/hi], a physical sensation, he wrote, it is [hi]physical [/hi] but it is also [hi]something else [/hi], not moral, not psychological, not spiritual, but [hi]something else [/hi], something other than the purely physical.

It is, however, worth noting some symptomatic cracks in the uniformity of their scorn for the products of the Culture Industry.
The suggestive outlines of a hierarchy of disdain can be traced: the &bquo;tragic Garbo&equo; is preferred to Mickey Rooney, Betty Boop to Donald Duck; their most acerbic denunciations are reserved not for &bquo;amusement&equo; or &bquo;light&equo; art in themselves, but for the attempt by the Culture Industry to absorb &bquo;light&equo; into &bquo;serious art&equo;, accommodating difference to the familiar &mdash; &bquo;Benny Goodman appears with the Budapest string quartet&equo;.

The model, as I have said, would be a degree in music, and would include history and theory as well as analysis.
Most importantly, it would also include exercises in composition, of the kind once common in the study of classics.
I prefer not to call this &bquo;creative writing&equo;, since the late-Romantic ideological implications of &bquo;creative&equo; are irrelevant, even undesirable.

Rasheed Araeen writes a lot, very confidently, about modernism.
Strange, isn't it, or perhaps not so strange, that the word is so much used by theoreticians and so little used by artists themselves? [/p] [p]
I would like to have read more on the subject by Frank Bowling, whose views seem not to be harmonised with Araeen's somewhat dogmatic viewpoint.
Bowling resembles a number of older artists in the exhibition in that he came to England (from Guyana, in his case) to be an artist, had some success, then moved to and fro between London and New York when his public career went downhill in the Sixties.
Could it be that there was then more racism in the <head>art</head>world, and that Black artists were being squeezed out at just the time when young working-class artists from the British provinces were finding unprecedented and immediate public fortune?

Moreover, men such as the great ecclesiastical architect Abbot Suger of St Denis (c. 1081&ndash;1151), who devoted his later years to composing a laudatory life of the French monarch Louis VI (1081&ndash;1137), effectively a second founder of the Capetian dynasty, wrote history with the object of producing favourable propaganda rather than documentary facts.
Suger's historical writings led the monks of his abbey to develop a taste for history and hence to compile a series of chronicles.
In the same century universal history also flourished, mainly with the object of determining the end of the world, after the year 1000 had passed without any sign of its impending occurrence.
This type of history was, of course, theologically rather than politically orientated.
The influence of the twelfth-century apocalyptic historians was destined, however, to be soon overshadowed by that of Joachim of Fiore (see pp. 81&ndash;2). [/p] [p]

Critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts, and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations.
In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise.
In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent, emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology, as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions.
According to this formalist approach art aspires to the condition of music, a phrase employed by Pater, but deriving from classical Greece. [/p] [p]

A large set of genes concerned with mimicry in butterflies became tightly linked together on the same chromosome, so tightly that they can be treated as one gene.
In Chapter 5 we met the more sophisticated idea of the evolutionarily stable set of genes.
Mutually suitable teeth, claws, guts, and sense organs evolved in carnivore gene pools, while a different stable set of characteristics emerged from herbivore gene pools.
Does anything analogous occur in meme pools?
Has the god meme, say, become associated with any other particular memes, and does this association assist the survival of each of the participating memes?

Part of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.
In qualifying &bquo;scientific&equo; by &bquo;in a broad sense&equo; Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.
However, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.
His frequent appeals to &bquo;scientific concepts&equo; and &bquo;scientific ideas&equo; often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal. [/p] [p]
The difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.
Take the example of Brunelleschi who, according to Kemp, introduced &bquo;scientific consistency&equo; into his use of perspective (p. 14).
The phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity other than <head>art</head> .

Terry Friedman's book contains fourteen chapters, which chart the development of the work and its public reception &mdash; a stormy one.
The topics include the first design, the sculptor's aims, the carving of the work, the memorial's defenders and attackers, and a final general reflection on the standing of great art and how it is likely to provoke opposition.
The monograph is accompanied by a facsimile of a sketchbook for the memorial, and documented by letters and printed sources, including articles in the press.

It is not surprising that this controversial Directive has not met the 1993 deadline, which the UK, centre of the European art market, says will drive the trade to the US, Switzerland or elsewhere.
The EC proposes to tax imports from outside the EC by applying the reduced rate of tax to the full price, or, in the case of those countries like the UK and Denmark which do not have a reduced rate, the standard rate to 30% of the price.
Exports from the EC, on the other hand, would be exempt, which, the UK maintains, in the long run will leach works of art from the EC countries.
At present, the UK operates a margin scheme (ie; it applies tax only to the difference between the purchase and the sale value) and exempts from VAT imports of paintings and works of art created before 1 April 1973 and items older than one hundred years.
It argues that, even at a reduced rate, VAT on imports from outside the EC would seriously damage the London <head>art</head>market.

Latin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.
That there should be an issue of the [hi]Oxford Art Journal [/hi] devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts. [/p] [p]
But new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.
Within the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.
In the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on <head>art</head>of a very different category &mdash; that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.

Many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child play or in the arts, the former finding clues in the activity which relate to child development, the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is good and beautiful.
Narrowing the field to either one or the other of these, has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identified a defining characteristic of their field.
For instance, Arnaud Reid (1982), in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is the requirement of &bquo;aesthetic intention&equo;, explains: [quote] [p]
For &mdash; cutting straight through the recurring controversies about whether, because of the varieties of the <head>arts</head>and of the infinity of differences between different individual works, &bquo;art&equo; can be &bquo;defined&equo; &mdash; one thing, I think, is clear.

The fall of Tarentum in 272 BC and the ravages of the wars of the Romans against Pyrrhus of Epirus, conducted in south-east Italy, led to the decline of the Greek cities of southern Italy and Sicily.
Pliny perhaps had this in mind when he wrote that art ceased in 296 BC.
Archaeological evidence points to a slightly later break, with a gap in the production of fine pottery, paintings and metalware from about 250 to 210 BC.
It may also be argued that Roman military advances effectively changed the artistic map of Italy.
Roads built to reach newly founded Roman colonies and to transport armies by-passed long-established cultural centres, leaving them to decay.
Other new centres were to flourish. [/p] [p]

``The Thief and the Dogs'' is a pioneering work, the first
stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint
Western readers.  The 1981 novel ``Wedding Song'' also is experimental, and
another badly aimed bullet.  The story of a playwright's stage debut
unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's ``The Sound
and the Fury.'' But the device obscures more than it illuminates.  Buried
in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for
integrity in an unfair world.  But again, the themes get tangled in Mr.

Not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings.  But many have.  ``
These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people,'' says

post-Watergate scandal.  Given their own penchant for book writing, it is

People are sensible to ignore these fruitless attempts at philosophy and &bquo;content themselves with daily experience&equo; and common sense, even if this is merely &bquo;feeding upon acorns&equo;.

&bquo;Most men wander out of the way, and fall into error for want of method, as it were for want of sowing and planting, that is, of improving the reason.&equo;
Given a method, we can avoid mistaken ideas which, confirmed by the authority of the past, have taken deep root, like weeds in men's minds. [/p] [p]

Whatever the basis of allocation, small service points will need an additional weighting if they are to maintain a reasonable range of materials. [/p] [p]
Nearly all authorities &mdash; even the most decentralized &mdash; reserve some money under central control to purchase material which the zones do not want, or cannot afford, or simply as a fund to cover emergencies.

In very general terms, what has characterized recent tendencies in the theoretical study and the practical teaching of language has been a distrust of authority and of the rules and conventions through which it is exercised.
Thus in the theoretical study of language the deference previously accorded to analysis and explanation by the informed observer has been questioned in favour of an uncommitted approach to enquiry, without preconception and without privilege, into the ways in which participants negotiate their own conditions for achieving their purposes.
And in language teaching, the idea that the teacher should direct the progress of learners has been questioned on the grounds that such direction impedes the natural process of learning.

But even more remarkable is the case of the Roman Republic, where for a century designs referring to the moneyers completely supplanted the symbols of the state; the moneyers had the freedom to choose their own personal designs, such as family achievements or origins (see fig. 15).

Equally important in building a framework for the future was the role played by the most anonymous of the ECSC's institutions, the Court of Justice.
Almost from the beginning, it was involved in hearing complaints relating to the operation of the ECSC.
Nearly all the cases that came before the Court were appeals by national governments and industries against decisions of the High Authority.
What was significant was that the vast majority of these appeals were rejected, and that while the Court had no means of enforcing its opinion, its verdicts were accepted, if not immediately implemented.

Abolition of discriminatory rules [/head] [p]
From the earliest days of the Community it was recognised that eliminating discrimination on grounds of nationality was as essential for securing the provision of services as it was for establishment.
For this reason EC Directives in the 1960s provided for the repeal of such legislation (in so far as it affected nationals of member states) as the requirement of West German law that foreign companies wishing to pursue business activities in West Germany must obtain special authorisation from the West German authorities.
Companies formed in the EC are similarly entitled to compete for tenders from public <head>authorities</head> , and to sub-contract work from such authorities, without discrimination on grounds of nationality.

If Christianity is true and if religion affects culture, then non-Christian religions, whose creeds must at some point involve the denial of some aspect of Christian truth, will reveal cultural problems resulting from inconsistencies which are impossible to reconcile given their religious postulates. [/p] [p]
The relevance of this can be seen by considering the present religious force in Western culture, namely a humanism which finds its embodiment in liberalism.
Ever since the Renaissance, but particularly since the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, Western culture has become imbued with a humanistic and a libertarian spirit.
As a religion humanism affirms some [pb] important absolutes.
It starts by proclaiming that God is dead or what comes to the same thing, that if he exists he is irrelevant.
From this it follows that &bquo;man is the measure of all things&equo;.

Similarly, the Labour government's policies on the reduction of the number of private pay beds did not always lead to enthusiastic implementation in the late 1970s.
A possible justification of the increased politicisation of appointments is more confidence in authorities and hopefully, a reduction in the need for detailed central interventions. [/p] [p]

Much of the resistance to the dependence thesis comes from confusing it with a claim about what authorities do in fact, or with the view that requires authorities to act only in the interests of their subjects.
But the most common confusion is between the dependence thesis and the no difference thesis, which was briefly discussed in the last chapter.

These childhood emotional relationships are further engendered by the integration into the authority pattern that is essential to mass production.
The arrangement of authority and functions whereby one manager supervises a foreman who in turn supervises workers is reminiscent of family authority systems.

Although there is some experience of contracting in such services as catering and cleaning, the scale of the programme set out in the White Paper is of a different order.
Initially, most contracts are likely to include only a broad specification of the service being purchased.
The finer details will have to be added at a later date when experience of operating in a contract culture has been gained. [/p] [p]
Third, before entering negotiations about contracts, purchasers will have to make an assessment of the services required to meet the health needs of their population.

The origins of this popular movement lie in the first wave of pressure for disarmament, which began with the emergence of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1958 and ended in 1964, with its decline in the face of the new Labour Government's failure to rid itself of nuclear weapons.
Resistance focused initially on nuclear testing and the existence of American bases on British soil, but it quickly broadened to encompass unilateral nuclear disarmament in general and a rejection of the Polaris missiles favoured by the then Conservative Government in particular.
The period was marked by mass demonstrations, of which the Aldermaston marches were the most successful as well as the best remembered, and by more direct forms of action such as well-planned and highly publicized sorties against selected US rocket bases situated in Britain.

Ling Trust started in 1987 as North-East Essex Community Care Trust (NEECCT), a charity theoretically distinct from the health authority.
This &bquo;hands-off&equo; status meant social security money could be obtained by charging residents, who would claim it back from the DSS, but staff for the homes were provided by the health authority's mental handicap unit through a separate agreement.
This, Mr Thomson said, was where the problems began. [/p] [p]
He complained that health <head>authority</head>officials sitting on the Ling Trust board, including unit general manager Murray Duncanson, would not surrender their control over staff at the homes. [/p] [p]

Two options were to be put to the Arab states, the first was to make their demands to Israel concerning borders, the return of the refugees, and so on, on the basis of determination to prosecute the war if Israel did not comply.

They are partisan accounts furthering the cause of certain strands in the common tradition, by developing and producing new or newly recast arguments in their favour.
The very activity is also an expression of faith in the tradition, of a willingness to understand oneself and the world in its terms and to carry on the argument, which in the area with which we are concerned is inescapably a normative argument, within the general framework defining the tradition.

In chapter 2 I discussed one of the central aims of the English curriculum, which is to extend the range of language in which children are competent.
Many children in our schools speak languages other than English.
For these children, therefore, this means adding competence in Standard English to their competence in other languages.
English is clearly the &bquo;first language&equo; of the education system.
But it would be a great loss if pupils' knowledge of a range of other languages was to decline. [/p] [p]

Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its
common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone, but a price was n't
disclosed.  Urban is the company's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin.
Since June, Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three
other Wisconsin firms.  A bill that would permit the Securities and
Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms '
holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms,
which argue that the legislation is unnecessary.  The legislation and other
issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week
by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate
Securities Subcommittee.  Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the SEC, has
n't taken a formal position on the bill, which would also require investors
to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional
<head>authority</head> during market emergencies.

of the quake.  But New York City general obligation bonds came under
selling pressure.  Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for
sale yesterday, pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage

This is the appropriate mood for The Hague, a town so bourgeois it makes Amsterdam seem rough and ready.

This is unfair, for it is a historic city and once in a while something does happen.

Sasbach is really no more than a scatter of houses, a couple of shops, a garage and a church set down in the middle of vineyards and orchards.

HOLIDAY resorts don't come much louder than Benidorm.
So you'll be surprised to learn that the town's tourist bosses are now taking urgent steps to control late-night noise. [/p] [p]
A map has been produced to show exactly what level of decibels the music in each street is allowed to reach. [/p] [p]
The map is colour-coded, easy to follow and essential for anyone booking a holiday in the resort. [/p] [p]
It will be particularly useful for early risers who once had to endure deafening music from Benidorm bars until the small hours.
All they have to do is pick a hotel or apartment away from the disco areas. [/p] [p]
Any <head>bar</head> or disco which exceeds its permitted decibel limit can be shut down on the spot for the night by police.

Many people seem to think that bar codes carry a lot of information.
For example, if you read the contents of a bar code on a can of baked beans, the common belief is that you would get something along the lines of &bquo;Heinz Baked Beans, 225g, 38p&equo;.

What is the &bquo;whisper&equo; from your inner self?
Does it reflect your belief that you are hopelessly absent-minded?
Or that people are mostly crooks?
Is it a metaphor for throwing away your resources &mdash; your time, money, energy &mdash; or allowing others to take advantage of you?
Perhaps you felt guilty about ignoring a charity collection, and so decided to punish yourself?
Or perhaps it is an opportunity to be more philosophical, less clinging, over money?
Perhaps the <head>bar</head> of chocolate was significant?

The basic idea is that you look through the book until you find a picture that is of the type you are going to take, and you then read the accompanying bar code into the camera.
Its programmed exposure system then sets the most suitable shutter speed and aperture under the prevailing circumstances.
If you are taking some sort of action shots for instance, the camera will set fast shutter speeds (to freeze the action) and use wide apertures if the light level is indifferent. [/p] [p]
Such a feature is clearly a waste of time if you are a reasonably expert photographer (and there is no bar code reader input on the professional EOS models), but it helps the non-expert to get good results.
Another use of bar codes is in security applications, and there must be many other novel uses for them. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

Plotting the points on a scatterplot [/head] [p]
Plot each point carefully, using a symbol such as a cross; if more than one point lands on the same spot, you could plot the number of points represented (i.e. the numeral 2 if two points are superimposed).

Arrange the bars in some sensible order, such as in order of their lengths.

As the community church was formed, the vision was for &bquo;intimacy&equo;.
It was not in this case a call to work in a particular area of the community, but rather it was a call to intimacy.
Intimacy with God, with each other, and with the neighbourhood in which we lived, following the example of Jesus in John 1:14: &bquo;The Word became flesh and lived for a while among us.&equo; [/p] [p]

These can be interpreted in a similar way to the maps of the Z2 Carbonate, with a belt of porous oolitic grainstones coinciding with the thickest part of the formation.
Between this belt and the basin margin, lagoonal sediments can be expected and beds of porous bioclastic grainstone may occur locally in this situation.
Basinwards of the zone of maximum thickness, a wedge of slope and basin plain sediments is present and porous dolomites may occur rarely at the foot of the mud-wedge. [gap] [ptr][/p] [caption]

(a) Was the provision in question valid?
The House of Lords did not decide either that it was, or that it was not.
They simply, and it seems correctly, decided that it was none of their business.

Either House of Parliament is perfectly capable of resolving that any of its previous decisions is to be regarded as a nullity.

Many people seem to think that bar codes carry a lot of information.
For example, if you read the contents of a bar code on a can of baked beans, the common belief is that you would get something along the lines of &bquo;Heinz Baked Beans, 225g, 38p&equo;.
This seems reasonable, because reading the bar code into a supermarket checkout system would result in this sort of information being displayed, and printed on the receipt. [/p] [p]
In reality matters re not as simple as this, and a do-it-yourself system that will provide a similar function is not a very practical proposition.
The problem is that the bar code only provides detailed information in an indirect fashion, and it is not readable straight from the code.
If you look at a <head>bar</head> code it will normally be accompanied by a long number (usually eight or thirteen digits long).

Bryan Adams has a tremendous knack of writing very catchy and memorable guitar parts, and although he's not particularly known as a lead soloist his rhythm playing approach is well worth looking at.
In this Style File (perhaps we should have called it a Riff File) we will look at some of his best known parts, as taken from his extremely successful &bquo;Reckless&equo; and &bquo;Waking Up The Neighbours&equo; LPs&hellip; [/p] [div3] [head]

Arrange the bars in some sensible order, such as in order of their lengths.
There is no special significance to the width of bars, but it should be uniform.

The bars should be solid, not just drawn in outline. [/p] [p]

If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets, he could be left

to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case.  A seizure also
would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers

automotive sector.  However, the company also lost orders because of
prolonged labor talks in the second quarter.  Third-quarter shipments
slipped 7 % from the year-ago period, and 17 % from this year's second
quarter.  Profit of steel shipped for the company's steel segment slid to $
26 a ton, from $66 a ton a year earlier and $57 a ton a quarter earlier.
Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices
for steel products.  Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products
offset lower prices for <head>bar</head>, hot-rolled and structural
steel.

After practicing law locally, he was elected to his first 10-year term as
judge in 1971; in 1981, he was effectively re-elected.  Six years ago,
Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State
Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges.  He has been considered several
times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in
Pennsylvania.  And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court
seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him ``one of the best
available,'' after interviewing local lawyers.  ``He probably was the

The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy
and boost compliance by the executives ``who are really calling the shots,''
said Brian Lane, special counsel at the SEC's office of disclosure policy,
which proposed the changes.  Investors, money managers and corporate
officials had until today to comment on the proposals, and the issue has
produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory, Mr. Lane said.
The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year, he said.  Not
all those who wrote oppose the changes.  The Committee on Federal
Regulation of Securities for the American <head>Bar</head>

Interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with
cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders,
Genetics Institute said.  The second patent describes bone morphogenetic
protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.  The
patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and
methods for treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said.
The company added that it has filed patent applications ``on a large number
of different BMP proteins'' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has
received.  BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating
bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the
company said.  The Bush administration's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a

Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence.

Little is still known of the designers and speculators of this part of the town's growth, save that they were often little more than smallholders or jobbing builders who saw the possibility of some quick profits on their small capital.
The most notorious of these streets, Pimlico off Church Street, was a derelict slum within ten years of its building around 1820, and by the 1870s it had to be demolished.
The cumulative effect was to make Brighton the fastest growing town in England between 1811 and 1821; the new inhabitants soon gave the resort an &bquo;artificial&equo; unhealthy climate to add to its more &bquo;natural&equo; freshness.

These works mark the beginning of a new maturity in Mozart's style, both in scoring (he now made full use of the range of instruments and good players available in Vienna) and in scope.
From now on wind instruments play an increasingly important role, engaging in independent dialogue rather than acting as &bquo;fillers&equo; for the strings.
All the orchestral music from 1784 onwards is conceived in broader strokes, while the solo parts become ever more complex. [ptr][/p] [caption]

The breadth of this term is useful, but it is necessary to use more specific reference to denote particular levels or types of visual problem in relation to the child's use of sight for learning.
The term &bquo;blind&equo; should be used carefully to describe those pupils who are completely without vision, or who have light perception only.
To use the term more widely may reduce the likelihood that the pupil will be encouraged to use any vision, however slight it may be. [/p] [p]
Clearly, <head>blind</head>pupils will be those who depend on tactile and auditory means of learning, and they will require specialised equipment and additional elements in their curriculum such as braille, mobility and orientation, but other aspects of their educational needs will include careful consideration of language development, concept formation, social interaction and information processing.

And for as long as the public continue to be wary of, or feel sorry for Down's children, there will be a considerable social stigma to contend with.

CHRIS EUBANK will today implore his manager Barry Hearn to &bquo;give Nigel Benn the &pound;1 million he wants to fight me &mdash; and let's get it on.&equo; [/p] [p]
Eubank was impressed by Benn's new maturity in his 11th-round stoppage of Welshman Nicky Piper in the first defence of his WBC super-middleweight title at the Alexandra Palace. [/p] [p]
&bquo;Nigel looked calmer than usual, his aggression was more controlled and that makes him a more dangerous fighter than before,&equo; said WBO title king Eubank.
After his triumph, Benn said: &bquo;I don't want to fight Eubank because I don't like him but I'll take it for the million he was asking for.&equo; [/p] [p]
He then added: &bquo;Although maybe now I'll just do what he does and fight a <head>bum</head> a month instead of taking the hard fights.

This composition of pop suggests occasional rupture and random fun-quake, rather than a benign process of amelioration, or accumulating body of good work.
There is a history to be written of the VOICE in pop, the voice that makes present the physicality of the body.
Which has its own story: Jagger's lips, Hendrix's cock, Bolan's gin, Prince's tongue, Morrissey's nipple (one of the few options of indecency left, to revel, to splay oneself-as-object, play thing). [/p] [p]

We have already seen the phallic symbolism of the plough in Dame Sirith and the Shipman's Tale; it is thematically appropriate that the Miller should swear by&quot;&quot; the oxen in my plogh&quot;&quot; when considering in his prologue whether he may be a cuckold or not (3151&mdash;62).
When Absolon brands Nicholas with the hot coulter there is an unmistakable innuendo that he disgraces the rampant Nicholas, who has replaced Alison at the window, with a homosexual assault.
[pb] Perhaps the most poignant echo in the tale comes towards the end where the townspeople, laughing at John,&quot;&quot; kiken and&hellip; cape&quot;&quot;,&quot; peer and gape&quot;, into his roof (3841), repeating the verb used of Nicholas pretending to be transfixed by his astrological vision (3444): the&quot;&quot; folk&quot;&quot; here align themselves with Nicholas &mdash; and with Nicholas the trickster, not Nicholas of the branded <head>bum</head> .

The Ego needs to make comparisons, to fulfil its duty as a messenger. [/p] [p]

A fire was burning in a black grate which had an oven to the side of it; a large black kettle was sizzling on the hob.
And at the foot of the iron structure was a high steel fender, suggesting from its dull surface that it had never seen emery paper since the day it left the foundry. [/p] [p]
Set at right angles to one side of the fireplace was a two-seat wooden settle, and at the other side a much larger leather couch.

There are copies of old magazines, many now defunct; there are films of the Coronation and photographs of the Queen on her many tours.

There are wonderful paintings collected by earlier monarchs who had a better eye. [/p] [p]
The final room consists of a series of three roomsets from Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor.

In his office high up in the twenty-five storey building that is 550 Fashion Avenue, mecca of the New York fashion industry, Hugo Varna sat at his desk and fiddled with the executive toy Sally had bought for him last Christmas.

Although Modigliani had rejected Simone Thiroux's claim on his paternity, and her child, a boy, was born in the spring of 1917, he was happy to acknowledge that Jeanne was carrying his child.
His relations with her mother, however, were anything but happy.
Madame H&eacute;buterne was constantly disapproving and interfering.
Zborowski had rented an apartment in the Rue Mass&eacute;na, but Modigliani was restless and unsettled living in a constrained atmosphere.
After all those years in Paris he found the bright sunshine and the sparkling translucence of the air disturbed his concentration and made it difficult for him to work.
In his portraits he looked for shade, for intimate interiors.
During his long stay in the south he made only one portrait with an out-of-doors setting; the pretty shopkeeper, sitting on a <head>chair</head> in front of her shop, looking out with uncomprehending suspicion against a white wall.

With the stickback style, however, it is only necessary to curve the top piece; the sticks would then position themselves into a curve, even from a straight base.
This base can be the rear seat rail, or another rail fitted above the seat, but if so, no more than 2in above the seat or it would also need to be curved to avoid discomfort.
The chair looks better to me if the seat is wider at the front than at the back, but the front of the seat should only be slightly wider than the top of the back.
Further on the point of comfort, a seat which slopes down slightly front to back is preferable to a horizontal seat. [/p] [p]
During a study of the various styles, it became apparent to me that if the back legs are set into the seat rails at an angle, this angle, together with the curvature of the rear legs and backward slope of the <head>chair</head> back can regulate the flair: if the legs are mounted at right angles to the rear seat rail, there would be no flair.

The &bquo;cheese&equo; is a local name for the pulped apples used in cider making and the stones are supposedly similar to the old cider presses until recently a feature of many a Cornish farm. [/p] [p]
A natural formation, geologists agree, but one story tells otherwise.
The Cheesewring was the result of the jealousy between the giants, who formerly held dominion over Cornwall, and the &bquo;invasion&equo; of saints and their growing influence over the Cornish. [/p] [p]
A meeting of the giants was called on Bodmin Moor to discuss the [pb] problem.
St. Tue, whose hermit's cell was nearby, heard of this and he attended the gathering to challenge Ulther, the leader of the giants, to a trial of strength.
If he lost, the saints were to leave Cornwall; and if he won, the giants were to consent to being baptised. [/p] [p]

The nurse also has to check the bathroom.
There has to be enough space for her and the patient, and preferably room for the carer to watch the washing session as well.
The floor should not be wet, polished or slippery, and there should not be loose rugs on it.

The posts may not necessarily be particularly lucrative (regius professorships are worth &pound;100 a year, religiously paid in quarterly &pound;25 cheques), but they are at some of the pinnacles of national life, they open doors and they command respect.
Unlike other university appointments, which are made by faculty boards or governing bodies on the basis of academic achievement, there is no formal selection process, and no open competition for regius professorships.
Those who wish to be appointed must somehow solicit the good opinion of the prime minister's appointments secretary.

The basic principle of his chair is that the knees should be below the pelvis, a quite different principle to the design of most chairs.
The usual type of chair puts an enormous strain on the spine, back muscles and many of the internal organs.
Anyone sitting down for extensive periods (as we all had to do in our school days) would have to tense many of the body's muscles in order to sit up straight.
This, in turn, causes the organs, the bones and, ultimately, the entire system to be under stress. [pb] [/p] [p]
The forward-tilting chair allows the spine and the postural muscles to support and balance the body naturally.
You can easily see the effect by placing a telephone book under each of the rear legs of a ordinary kitchen chair.
At first, the sensation may seem strange but, after a few minutes, you will appreciate its comfort.

Unhappy endings were more familiar to the welfare workers.
Moritz, a Polish boy born in Cologne, was a smiling, good-looking child when he arrived in June 1939.
Aged thirteen, he spent two years at a Cardiff school, where he learned English, and then trained as an electrician.
About the time he started work he became obsessed that he would never see his parents again; he feared that they were already dead.
He was probably right.
Authority, any authority, was blamed for the tragedy.
Moritz antagonised his employer, who promptly sacked him, and refused help from his friends.
In 1942 he was persuaded to go into hospital, where he was said to be schizophrenic.
A year later he was certified insane.

Stage 2: Reviewing the experience [/head] [p]
If we are to learn from an experience it is vital to review what happened during the experience.

In 1961 the British and French governments agreed to set up a working group to consider the merits of the rival proposals and at the beginning of 1964 Ernest Marples, the British Transport Minister, and his French counterpart announced that the two governments would go ahead with a tunnel.
In 1973 a [pb] start was actually made, but the following February the Heath Government fell.
Labour inherited three major public spending projects: the third London airport to be built at Maplin, the supersonic Concorde aircraft and the Channel Tunnel.
Labour wanted economies and the first project to perish was Maplin.
But that was not enough for the new Chancellor, Denis Healey.
In effect there was a choice between Concorde and the Channel Tunnel.
Concorde (which was to be partly built in Bristol) benefited from a strong local lobby including a local MP, Tony Benn, who had now become a member of the Labour Cabinet.

Periodically he returned to his Australian roots, but for long periods he worked in the UK.

From the 1970s on, he expanded first into US newspapers (the [hi]New York Post [/hi], for example) and then into film [pb] and TV, buying control of Metromedia and Twentieth Century Fox (whose massive film archive could feed his TV channels).

At worst, Western politicians, and some academic and journalistic [pb] commentators, have shared the mentality of the apparatchiks, but most have remained attached to their illusions that differences between East and West were based on misunderstandings rather than fundamental disagreements.

Even a cynical American politician like Richard Nixon did not approach the habitual level of -doublethink' which an ideologically motivated communist like Ceau&scedil;escu regarded as natural.
Since the revolution in 1989, it has been revealed that not only was Romania passing on [hi]some [/hi] of the Western secrets obtained in the long honeymoon with the West to Moscow, but that Ceau&scedil;escu's brother, Ilie, the Deputy Defence Minister, was passing Soviet military secrets and technology to the Americans.

WAR CLOUDS OVER EUROPE read the banner headlines at the opening of Reed's earlier film, [hi]Bank Holiday [/hi] (1938), a picture whose setting suggests escapism but whose narrative argues for the need to face up to the dark side of life in order to find meaningful happiness.
Margaret Lockwood plays a nurse who, on the eve of a bank holiday, has to console a man whose wife has just died in childbirth.
Preoccupied with the thoughts of his suffering, the trivial concerns of her lover become increasingly aggravating as they hang around with the crowds at Brighton.
He seems over-concerned about what people think of them, to lust after her but not deeply love her.
Fearful that the widower will take his life, she rushes back to London, to a man grieving for a woman who once said to him: &bquo;don't be silly, there's no hurry, we've all our lives.&equo; [/p] [p]
The mood of [hi]Bank Holiday [/hi] reflects that of a nation knowing that war must come, but other films dealt more directly with the storm clouds building up on the other side of the <head>Channel</head> .

It took all the courage he had to thrust his head and shoulders into the mouth of that entrance, but he closed his eyes and twisted and turned and after a time tumbled out into a great stone chamber, lit with a soft light of its own that dimmed the glitter of his shining key.
It was a miracle he thought, that the glass had not shivered in that tight struggle, but it was as clear and brittle as ever.
So he looked about him, and saw three things.
The first was a heap of glass bottles and flasks, all of them covered with dust and cobwebs.
The second was a glass dome, the size of a man, and a little taller than our hero.
And the third was a shining glass coffin, lying on a rich velvet pall on a gilded trestle.
And from all these things the soft light proceeded, like the glimmering of pearls in the depth of water, like the phosphorescent light that moves of itself on the night surface of southern seas, or shines round the heaving shoals, milky-white over their silver darts, in our own dark <head>Channel</head> .

The attractions of a sea-to-sea waterway had taxed the brains of both James Watt ( [hi]q.v. [/hi]) and John Rennie before Thomas Telford ( [hi]q.v. [/hi]) was commissioned by the Government in 1802 to construct the canal.
Its benefit was that shipping could avoid the dangerous passage round the north coast of Scotland and &mdash; as Britain was at war with France &mdash; there was great strategic value in providing a protected route for warships.
The canal took 18 years to complete, twice as long as Telford had forecast, and cost more than double what he had estimated, but it was an outstanding engineering achievement for the time, even though the actual length of genuine canal that had to be dug was only 21 miles, since the navigable <head>channel</head>took advantage of existing lochs along the glen.

Elevation of intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] by the photolysis of caged Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] induces a form of synaptic potentiation, but the relationship between this effect and LTP has not been determined (for example, occlusion experiments have not been done).
Elevation of intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi], either by evoking Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] currents or by slowly depleting intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] stores, does not induce LTP.
This could be due either to the failure of these methods to elevate Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] in the appropriate manner (presumably what is needed is a large transient within spines) or to the need for additional pre- and/or postsynaptic signals. [/p] [p]
In summary, the available evidence suggests that under normal conditions Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] permeates NMDA <head>channels</head>to provide a transient signal which is necessary for the induction of LTP.

But, as so often, no one was prepared to halt the machine once set in motion and on Friday 26 January 1744 Admiral Jacques de Roquefeuil sailed out of Brest with a fleet of 22 ships, with instructions to cover the embarkation of the army at Dunkirk and then to lure the English fleet away towards the Isle of Wight. [/p] [p]
By the time de Roquefeuil had reached the island Admiral Sir John Norris, a first-class sailor, had assembled his force in the Downs off Dover.
On Saturday 17 February 1744 de Roquefeuil, having found the seas off the Isle of Wight apparently free of English warships, sent a despatch-boat to Dunkirk advising de Saxe to embark his men.
He then sailed on to Dungeness where Sir John Norris's fleet now appeared in strength.
It delayed attacking till the following morning, and a calm during the night enabled the French ships, showing no lights, to make their escape and simply drift down <head>Channel</head> , only to be overtaken around midnight by a ferocious north-east gale.

This e.p.s.p. can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists, such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor-mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors [hi]&agr;- [/hi] amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA).
This receptor corresponds to the cloned family GluR1&ndash;4 [hi]47 [/hi].
When the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway is stimulated it also activates GABAergic interneurons (through glutamatergic synapses similar to those on pyramidal neurons) and this leads to the biphasic i.p.s.p. which curtails the e.p.s.p.

More straightforwardly, awareness of another nation's literature helps to create for authors a sense of the particular character and limitations of their own, encouraging the pursuit of alternatives and possibilities for innovation and change.
If experimental novelists metaphorically stare across the Channel, it is not only because they hope some valuable contraband &mdash; fresh styles from France &mdash; may be smuggled through English literary customs.
It is because aspects of foreignness itself, of vision focused by contact with other nations and languages, may be a crucial encouragement to the sort of writing they produce. [/p] [p]

Calmodulin affinity chromatography has also been used to purify a related 63K/240K channel complex from pig and rat ROS membranes.
This suggests that the channel complex and its interaction with calmodulin is conserved, at least for mammalian ROS.
These results indicate that calmodulin affinity chromatography can be used to purify the cGMP-gated channel complex from ROS membranes and that the 240K channel-associated polypeptide binds calmodulin in a Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent manner.
On the basis of these findings, calmodulin modulation of the <head>channel</head>activity is likely to occur through Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent interaction of calmodulin with the 240K channel-associated protein.

As part of the normal processes of a river, the stones in these shoals are neatly sorted and graded by the flowing water into an overlapping fish-scale pattern known as &bquo;armouring&equo;, which makes them relatively stable.
By dredging up gravel, therefore, river managers were actually de-stabilizing the river bed, thereby contributing to the erosion which they were supposedly trying to prevent.
Riverside trees, whose roots increase the tensional strength of the bank material, are the best protection against erosion, especially if they are well established and are properly maintained.
They also reduce land loss, since it is estimated that <head>channels</head>with 50 per cent tree and shrub cover on both banks require only approximately half the width for a given volume of bankfull flood-water speeding through the channel, compared to treeless brooks which erode out into the adjacent fields.

advertising campaign, were n't disclosed.  Mr. John becomes the latest of
many music stars, including George Michael and Whitney Houston, to appear
in ads for the diet drink.  Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed
a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and, eventually,
to U.S. theaters, too.  The operator of cable-television networks said the
new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner
Broadcasting's Turner Network Television <head>channel</head>, or TNT,
and then will be released internationally in movie theaters.

CBS has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids --
that is, can the network alone make a profit on it?  Mr. Pilson emphasizes
the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations,
enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to
watch other CBS programs when the game is over.  The billion-dollar
question is, How much are those benefits worth?  Some TV people doubt they
will materialize and argue that even if they do, they wo n't offset the
multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up.  ``As we 've seen in
the '80s,'' says Roger Werner, the president of the ESPN sports
<head>channel</head>, ``those deals can turn sour if the numbers do

In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc.'s
powerful Home Box Office, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to
buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $225 million.  The
purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between
TCI and Viacom, which has also discussed the sale of an interest in
Showtime with other cable operators.  Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home
Box Office, and in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time
Warner, charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable
units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business.  HBO has close to
24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks, while Showtime and
its sister service, The Movie <head>Channel</head>, have only about
10 million, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research

In autumn last year, for example, the regime garrison at Kandahar was
prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates.  At the last minute,
however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most
hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be
made to his forces.  The deal fell through, and Kandahar remains a major
regime base.  The resistance lacks not only air power, armor and expertise
but often such essentials as maps, mine detectors, or even winter gloves.
Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege
tactics to wear down the regime.  Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan

In a telephone interview, Robert Thomson, TCI senior vice president, said
Showtime's suit against HBO ``does n't involve us, and nothing we 're doing

Time Warner said its cable division turned in a 77 % increase in operating
cash flow, to $166 million from $94 million, reflecting higher
per-subscriber revenue.  In addition, the 1988 results included a $20
million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at
American Television &amp; Communications Corp.  On the other hand, Time Warner
said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine
division, its books division and the Home Box Office programming division.
In magazines, higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune
were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines.  The programming
division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter
included a $12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because
the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO's

Studies which illustrate the pain and distress many relinquishing mothers experience for years to come (sadly, information about fathers is unavailable) would suggest a more inclusive form of adoption (Panor and Baran, 1984; Winkler and Keppel, 1984).

The only exception would be if a child's life was in danger.
This became law immediately in England and Wales, and is part of the new Children's Act.
It was believed that similar action would follow very quickly in Scotland, where the Child Care Law Review was nearing completion.
This review of child-care in Scotland began before the children in Orkney were taken from their homes early on a February morning.

The purpose of this paper is to examine further the issue of open adoption or adoption with contact. [/p] [div2] [head]
BACKGROUND [/head] [p]
In 1984, the Court of Session in Edinburgh (Hay/Briton against Central Regional Council) refused a 53 year old grandmother custody or access to her six year old grandchild, though it was agreed that the &bquo;most significant relationship&equo; the child had was with this grandmother.
The Court's decision was largely influenced by the evidence of a psychologist who claimed that to award custody or access to the grandmother would diminish the child's prospect of developing &bquo;a balanced personality&equo;.
The report in the Scottish Law Times does not refer to any evidence to support the view that the maintenance of contact between a <head>child</head> and a birth relative to whom he or she has attachments would cause harm to the child's developing personality.

Nevertheless, it is remarkable that despite administrative differences, the problems facing residential care in Flanders and the Netherlands and the recent changes in policy are very similar to those found in the United Kingdom.
Indeed, those with knowledge of the British scene will recognize many of the points made about Flanders and the Netherlands.
For example, the regional distribution of residential and foster care services in the United Kingdom is known to be uneven [pb] with some local authorities using EBD schools and residential care far more frequently than others (Fuller and Stevenson, 1983).
Hence, whether a child is placed with a foster family or in residential care may not so much depend on the child's needs but on where he or she happens to live.
One local authority in England, Warwickshire, has closed all its residential provision for <head>children</head> in care.

Commentators in this school tend to emphasise class and economic variables as factors producing poor standards of child care, and to de-emphasise parental culpability and personal inadequacy.
Thus, in this view parents as well as children tend to appear as victims and, in particular, working-class parents are seen as vulnerable and powerless [hi]vis-&agrave;-vis [/hi] statutory agencies.
It is thought that the separation of children from poor parents, the keeping of children apart from parents and the removal of parental rights are undertaken too readily by these agencies.
Ideally, steps should not be taken to remove children from parental care unless there is clearly no other way to prevent harm to them and unless other options, such as day-care, financial and housing help, have been investigated first.
When <head>children</head> [hi]have [/hi] been removed, positive efforts should be made to rehabilitate them with their parents as soon as possible. [/p] [p]

It never drew large crowds and [hi]The Birds [/hi] was no exception.
During one of the indiscriminate assaults by the murderous flocks of birds the screaming inhabitants of the town ran to and fro in a vain attempt to ward off their attackers.
From the cinema itself there also came a piercing cry.
The lights were on in a second and the usherette was at the screamer's side.
The woman concerned was in a state of shock.
A bird had gained entry through one of the broken windows and flown helplessly around until it collided with her.
The woman had lashed out in fear and given the bird a fatal blow, feathers everywhere.
She was helped from her seat and taken to the rear of the cinema.
The remains of the bird were gathered up and removed.

ACCESS FOR PARENT OR PUPIL? [/head] [p]
In much of the discussion it has been assumed that it is a parent who seeks the information.
If access is seen as part of the right of autonomy of the individual, one might ask why parents, rather than the children themselves, should have access.
If it is seen as part of control over quality of education, the parent might ask why the child should be given access at all.
In most cases the issue raises no problems, but estranged parents using the <head>child</head> to fight their bat ties or rebellious teenagers seeking recognition of their maturity and autonomy against over-protective or interventionist parents may see it as an important issue of principle.

One of the great strengths of the Hearing system in Scotland is its informality.
The lay panel, the rights of parents and children to be accompanied by a friend or supporter, and the complete absence of any professional legal formality generally help to reduce the tension and create a situation for discussion.
The presence of the high-powered lawyers at this second Children's Hearing in Orkney immediately charged the atmosphere. [/p] [p]
The Hearing began with a formal decision to dispense with the presence of the children.
The Reporter, Gordon Sloan, told the three Panel Members that the grounds for referral had not changed since the last Hearing three weeks previously.
He considered it was potentially damaging to the <head>children</head> to be at the Hearing, and, besides, the case of Proof before the Sheriff was still pending.

Hence, subject and support teachers will need to develop expertise in modifying curriculum materials [hi]and [/hi] managing behaviour problems. [/p] [p]
In conclusion, I am advocating that, as the whole-school approach grows in popularity as a positive response to children with special educational needs, it is important that schools, as organisations, and teachers, as individuals, reject the segregationist policy towards disruptive pupils which might appeal to some teachers and government policy makers.
By embracing the evidence from the &bquo;effectiveness of schools&equo; research and adopting a whole-school approach to special educational needs, we can create a truly comprehensive service of education in which it is accepted that ALL teachers have responsibility to meet the needs of ALL <head>children</head> .

Having children so early in their marriage was a mixed blessing.

When Simon the Trapper parted from him on the great north ride the Friar loosened the rope that girdled his waist, dragged up his gown a score of inches to free the movement of his lower legs, re-tied his girdle tightly, wiped his hands on the none too clean garment and taking hold of his staff set off up the highway in pursuit of his sack, of Marian, and of the verderers. [pb] [/p] [p]
The Friar was easy-natured and slow to anger.
He was casual, careless and lazy unless roused; when roused he became energetic and tireless until his anger was assuaged.
As his judgement suffered in his calmer moments from overconfidence, so in his energetic ones it suffered from being too headlong.
After the fight with the beggars he had left the sack with Allen and Marian because it had seemed to him an ingenious way of saving himself the trouble of carrying it to Simon's hut and back again while at the same time it was a guarantee that the <head>children</head> would remain until he returned.

Curiously, Gill and Jackson are aware of the problem of identity confusion but believe that it can be avoided if black children are placed transracially when very young: &bquo;it is possible that older black children may, by the time a placement has occurred, have already internalised a definition of themselves as being black and that this definition may jeopardise the possibility of integration and emotional identification within a white family&equo; (p. 138).
The argument seems to be that the world of reality and the concept of self are or should be structured by white parents and society.
Thus children should be placed transracially at a very young age, so becoming &bquo;white in all but skin colour&equo;.
If they already have a concept of themselves as black it will be too late to &bquo;turn them white&equo;.
Bean, writing a year later in 1984, supported this view by saying that &bquo;when the adopted <head>child</head> is an older child who has already acquired a cultural background and a set of cultural responses, these will have to be unlearned if he or she is to acquire a new cultural identity&equo;.

Some concerns the basic methodological pitfalls surrounding any project of this kind &mdash; the lack of proper controls, over-readiness to read richer interpretations into bits of behaviour than a more rigorous viewpoint would endorse, even experimenters' proneness, given their wishful thinking, to be manipulated by their hairy charges into taking up certain attitudes not properly grounded in the available evidence.
Another set of criticisms concerns the basic approach, given the desired object of establishing communicative contact with and among the apes concerned.
Anyone can see that artificial keyboard or lexigram languages can be imparted, if at all, in only the most impoverished social situations &mdash; quite unlike the nexus of warm and intimate physical bonds that probably prevailed at the dawn of language millennia ago.

There is some irony in the fact that many schools are on the one hand educating children about healthy eating and on the other selling at break time nothing less than junk foods such as crisps, chewy fruit sweets and chocolate bars.
The attractions of these products are that they store well, are easily obtained and offer a high profit margin.
Fresh fruit and raw carrots are an alternative and represent healthier eating but they are perishable, less profitable and need some preparation before sale.
The response to the dilemma by a growing number of schools is to completely abandon the sale of food at breaks and to look to other means to generate funds.

insurance wo n't cover.  And while the job is half done, Brooks is still
bitter.  In fact, there's only one person involved who's happy, and that's
Floyd String, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck
solution.  Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when
the approach was suggested, Mr. String says, Brooks officials ``did n't
laugh at me or anything.  ``Parenthood,'' this summer's successful and

Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a

ages of six and 18.  The women indicated which family member usually did
various household chores and the approximate share each did.  Not

about 80 % of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two-thirds of

area, they lose their bearings,'' says Maury Elvekrog, a licensed

They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right

for $15, a version customized to the age of the child and the college of
choice.  The figures are shocking.  To build a nest egg that would pay for
Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age, parents would
need to set aside $773.94 a month -- for 12 years.  They can cut this to $
691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college.  And they can
further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when
mother and child come home from the hospital.  Plugging a cheaper college
into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can

On the other hand there is the micro-world which we find more personal and meaningful, the world &bquo;of the family and private associations, the world of personal tastes, sports, hobbies and leisure pursuits.

Not all the clergy and all the religious orders have been actively engaged in the pursuit of this ideal, but one or two orders have been; for example, the Christian Brothers are devoted to the ideals of a Christian and catholic education, and supporters of the concept of a nation dedicated to God and at the same time distinctly Irish.
In making this comment, one is merely pointing out particular ideological characteristics in hard-working, deeply religious, and committed people.
However, in the practical context of an Ireland divided between two power blocs, such a nationalist form is profoundly ethnic and exclusivist, whatever its believed aims and ideal content.
There is an elective affinity between this cultural vision and the religious vision of the Roman catholic <head>church</head> prior to the second Vatican Council, in its exclusivist attitude towards other Christian churches, an attitude which is far from overcome at the level of popular Roman catholicism.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, two fresh problems came into the open, particularly through the work of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729&ndash;81).
Lessing was a man of many parts &mdash; writer, literary critic, historian, advocate of religious tolerance &mdash; who also made pioneering contributions to the study of the New Testament, and was from time to time embroiled in the continuing controversies between rationalism and orthodoxy.
It is in that setting that these two problems belong. [/p] [p]
The first was relatively straightforward.
Once the Bible began to be approached as historical material, open to critical historical study, it was natural that the New Testament, and in particular [pb] the life and personality of Jesus himself, should come to be re-examined.
Might not Jesus himself have been rather different from the picture given of him in the gospels and the subsequent teaching of the <head>church</head> ?

In our concern for church growth it is imperative that we discern the relationship between the growth of the Church and the realisation of the Kingdom.
Too close an identification will blind us to the shortcomings of the institutional Church, so that church growth becomes denominational aggrandisement.
As soon as our focus of attention moves from Christ to the Church we move towards ecclesiastical deification and our evangelism is in great danger of degenerating into proselytism. [/p] [p]

Coleridge and Sara fixed their wedding for early October, and in the meantime began looking for a home.
The cottage which they eventually discovered at Clevedon, on the Somerset coast south of Bristol, was not quite the &bquo;honeymoon cottage&equo; it has often been called.
Coleridge viewed it rather as another home for Pantisocracy, even though his companions and fellow believers were reduced now to Sara herself and George Burnett.
(His concern for the floundering Burnett showed Coleridge at his best during these months: Southey abandoned Burnett; Coleridge stayed loyal to him, even though the two men were not special friends.) [/p] [p]
The cottage &mdash; which was probably not the cottage now bearing a commemorative tablet &mdash; lay in a wooded &bquo;Valley of Seclusion&equo; at the west end of Clevedon, close to the parish <head>church</head> where Arthur Hallam is buried.

When the House of Commons considered the matter in 1953, its views were affected by the fact that they were unaware of any evidence of pressure for change from the churches themselves.
It can, however, no longer be assumed that that is so, and in any case it is not clear that if a clergyman wishes to stand and electors wish him to represent them the mere fact that the churches do not like the idea has anything to do with matter.
For the time being, and probably for the foreseeable future, the rather vague criterion remains that of &bquo;episcopal ordination&equo;, vague because that procedure is not peculiar to the Anglican Church.
To attempt to confine the disqualification to &bquo;true&equo; episcopal ordination takes the argument back at least to the Reformation and perhaps to St. Peter.
Clergy in the <head>Church</head> of Wales at least are spared this; their disqualification, if any, was removed by the Welsh Church Act 1914. [/p] [p]

In this &bquo;evangelism equals church planting&equo; model, the priority may be seen as a desire to make sure every community throughout the earth is covered by a church that is alive and preaching the good news of Jesus Christ.
This would include putting a church in every housing estate so that members can speak to their neighbours about Christ, and bring his love in practical ways to the poor and the oppressed spiritually and physically.
So another reason for church planting has to do with taking more ground for Jesus. [/p] [/div3] [div3] [head]

His choice was a certain Elizabeth Augusta Josephine Parkes, daughter of Ebenezer Parkes of [pb] [gap] [ptr][gap] [ptr][pb] Fetter Lane, a brass-rule maker for the printing trade.
Quite a nice catch for him, we might think, though who was catching whom exactly may not be so easy to determine &mdash; many a man, according to a rather cynical 19th-century doctor, was &bquo;bounced into marriage&equo;.

The church gets its name from the adjacent hospice where pilgrims on their way to or from Rome once stayed.
The hospice was closed in 1770 and pulled down.
The church is noticeable for its dowdy appearance, the barely visible fresco of St Peter in the circle above the door and its general air of being run down.
At one time there were fine frescoes inside by pupils of Giotto, but even these have gone.
So why bother to come?
There are two reasons: firstly, in the summer of 1990 major work started on the church which could restore it to something like its original form; this would make it interesting, because pilgrim churches are rare.
Secondly, its position, hard up against a modern building, and beside and across from many more, demands attention.

The absence of endowments before the time of the Emperor Constantine inevitably meant that well-to-do Christians had much influence on their local communities, which could be decisive when a new bishop was being chosen.
But care for the poor remained a prime task of bishops.
The Roman empire was no welfare state, and before Christian times in the West (unlike the East) care for the poor was rare.
Poverty is a relative term.
The Latin [hi]pauper [/hi] means a person of modest means rather than someone without food, roof, or clothing; Ovid defined him as &bquo;a man who knows how many sheep he owns&equo;.
The Christians sought to protect the destitute, or those who had fallen in status and resources like widows and orphans.
They provided hospices for the sick or for raising the innumerable foundlings.
In the mid-third century the Roman <head>church</head> was feeding 155 church officials of various grades, and more than 1,500 widows and distressed persons.

This change has been chiefly in the direction of the broadening of its outlook on life.&equo;

Following the passing of the 1689 Toleration Act, which gave Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, and other dissenters from the Anglican church the right to worship in public, new nonconformist meeting-houses began to be constructed throughout England.

In Rome Easter was celebrated on the Sunday following the full moon after the spring equinox, and was a memorial of the resurrection.
In the 150s Polycarp of Smyrna visited Rome; no agreement was reached.
In the 190s it seemed intolerable to the then bishop of Rome, Victor, that the churches in Asia Minor celebrated Easter on a different date, and to the distress of many he threatened excommunication on those who did not adopt the Roman date.
Since the churches of Asia Minor in all probability had the more ancient observance, they refused submission, and the difference continued. [/p] [p]

Under the laws of the land, the ANC remains an illegal organization, and
its headquarters are still in Lusaka, Zambia.  But the unconditional

More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure

unruly spirits, and he often obliges.  ``On certain occasions a spirit
could be earthbound and make itself known,'' he says.  ``It happens.''
Father Trabold often uses what he calls ``a therapeutic exorcism'': a few
prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave.  ``If the person believes
there's an evil spirit, you ask it to be gone,'' he says.  ``The suggestion
itself may do the healing.'' But sometimes more energetic attacks are

heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial
rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification
Church members in the U.S. Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate-beleaguered
Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for
income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts.
Defections, burnouts, and abduction ``deprogrammings'' kept member turnover

the result of the ``graying'' of the church.  Many of the enthusiastic

The obvious first buy is a pack of small resistors, such 0.25 watt 5 per cent types.
A pack of around 1000 resistors can be had for well under &pound;10, which is clearly under 1p per resistor.
Even if a few of the resistors are never used, this still represents a very cheap and easy way to buy resistors.

And there is strong talk in France that the Longines Classic, which had an October date, will not now take place. [/p] [p]
If this is correct, the women's calendar will be cut to 11 tournaments, though that figure does not take in the Solheim Cup or the New World Cup to be held in Taiwan. [/p] [p]
The anticipated loss of two events is not the end of unwelcome news.
According to French sources, the problems with the Longines Classic started at last year's event when, though the sponsors paid out the prize money, it did not reach the players.

A LEGEND originating in the island of Kythnos, Greece, tells how March was so angry with an old woman for thinking he was a summer month that he borrowed a day from his brother, February, and froze her and her flocks to death. [/p] [p]
March is often a windy month and because the winds are unsteady at this time of year there is always a chance of very changeable weather from day to day.
How true were the observations of Ecclesiastes: &bquo;The wind goeth towards the south and turneth about into the north: it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his <head>circuits</head> .&equo; [/p] [p]

Sometimes the distortion is given as a decibel figure: if the distortion voltage is one thousandth of the fundamental voltage the distortion is -60dB, i.e. 60dB down on the fundamental. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Fundamental Filter [/head] [p]
Eliminating the fundamental is not easy.
A distortion of 0.1 per cent means that the harmonic power is 60dB down.
A filter which attenuates the fundamental by 60dB still allows as much fundamental to get through as distortion, giving an exaggerated distortion figure.
Modern amplifiers may have distortion levels as low as 80dB below fundamental, or even lower.
Filters of exceptionally good performance are needed.
However, they need only eliminate one single frequency.
This eases the problem, because a number of <head>circuits</head>exist which give a complete null at one frequency. [/p] [p]

At one time the best way of travelling between the different parts of the island was by boat.
Nowadays there are still tourist boats taking visitors to see Cabo Gir&acirc;o or Machico or to swim in the sheltered coves, but Madeira now has a fine road network stretching to every small hamlet, whether it be on the top of a mountain or in the bottom of a valley.
Most of the main roads are in good condition, but driving can be very tiring as there are many bends, and most of the roads are built onto the mountainside with deep ravines dropping away below, and you never quite know what's around the corner &mdash; be it a bus straddling the centre of the road to take a corner or a group of children playing football in the road.

Researchers built the channel so that it is free of dopants, stopping the charges from bumping into impurity atoms along the way.
Instead, a layer of doped silicon is placed directly underneath the channel.
This dopant layer sets the voltage at which the transistor turns off and on. [/p] [p]
As a result, the mobility of the charges as they travel through the transistor is twice as good as any similar, submicron p-channel mosfet transistor yet built. [/p] [p]
A p-channel transistor, relying on hole mobility, is usually slower than an n-channel device.
The goal is to use the improved p-channel transistor to boost the speed of complementary circuits where both types of transistors work together. [/p] [p]

If the glider is in a very steep climb this should be reduced slightly before yawing.
A common fault is to level out too much, which results in a completely slack cable and makes the winch driver's job of judging the correction quite impossible. [/p] [p]
In turbulent air the launch should be abandoned if the launching speed becomes really excessive.
(Usually this is the pilot's fault for holding the glider down too much during the initial climb, or failing to get right up into the normal angle of climb.)
If a decision is made to abandon the launch at height, it is safer to release first and then to lower the nose, as this prevents the risk of the cable parachute opening and flying up over the aircraft.
Should the latter ever happen, it is best to land ahead regardless rather than attempt a <head>circuit</head> .

The recent development of the electronic ballast switches on a new era in lighting technology.
However, its advantages will not be fully realised until the recession slows, sales pick up and unit costs fall.
Electronic ballasts can save up to 30 per cent of the energy consumed by a conventional coil-core wire-wound ballast.
This is possible for two reasons: a reduction in internal losses and increased lamp efficiency due to a much higher operating frequency.
The higher frequencies of 25&ndash;35 k.Hz eliminate flickering and stroboscopic effects. [/p] [p]
Some electronic units will start a lamp in less than 0&ndash;5 seconds; dimming the source to 5 per cent of normal output is also possible. [/p] [p]

As is pointed in International Rectifier's note AN-969m power mosfets possess advantages over bipolar transistors for ignition circuits, chiefly because of the high voltages then must withstand when used in place of a conventional mechanical contact breaker.
Power mosfets exhibit no secondary breakdown and can be avalanched to clamp excessive overvoltage due to leakage inductance or a disconnected HT lead.
Also, they need no base drive, being voltage controlled.
The note explains that the series resistance of the mosfet need not lead to inefficiency and a circuit performing at higher efficiency than the one using bipolars is feasible. [/p] [p]
Modern ignition coils are of low inductance with ballast resistors for improved cold starting; inductive discharge <head>circuits</head> , as opposed to the older capacitive discharge types, require the discharge of typically 6A, a bipolar transistor needing safe-operating-area clamps, which increase both cost and dissipation.

Clearly, detecting the opening and closing of the points under static conditions will be somewhat problematic since most ohmmeters will not just be able to detect such a small change in resistance. [/p] [p]
The circuit shown in Fig. 2 (based on a comparator) will, however, detect changes in resistance of less than 0.1 ohm.
The circuit requires a 9V d.c. supply (50mA maximum) and operates an l.e.d. which will provide a visual indication whenever the contact breakers are open.
The threshold sensitivity of the instrument is adjusted by means of VR1.
In order to set this for optimum sensitivity, a one ohm resistor should be connected across the probes and the control is adjusted until the l.e.d. [hi]just [/hi] becomes illuminated.
The resistor can now be removed and the instrument will be ready for use.
If necessary, the <head>circuit</head>of Fig. 2 can be duplicated to permit simultaneous adjustment of both engines on a twin engined aircraft. [/p] [p]

Feedback resistors of 3k&ohm; are included in the chip but, again, external resistors can be used for other gain settings; care must be exercised here, though, to avoid instability, increased noise and reduced bandwidth.
Output voltage offset is trimmable in the usual way by a pot between null pins, although this method does have the slight disadvantage that input offset is affected: 1mV of output offset change alters input offset by about 1&micro;V, also altering output offset drift by 3&micro;V/&deg;C per 1mV.

But traders on the exchange floor, who can observe the computer-guided
trading activity on monitor screens, said most of the top program-trading
firms were active both days.  Through August, the top five program trading
firms in volume were Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc.  Though
brokerage officials defended their use of program trading, one sign of what
an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record.
Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady
Commission report, they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed
Monday to restore the markets 'equilibrium.  On Friday, the stock-index
futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures
contract -- a ``<head>circuit</head> breaker'' procedure instituted
after the 1987 crash and implemented for the first time.

Leo Melamed, Merc executive committee chairman, said that the 12-point
limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13.  But when the contract
reopened, the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the
contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit
of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices
synchronized.  Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12-point
circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional
selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  All of the
changes require regulatory approval, which is expected shortly.  The
exchange also said that the 30-point <head>circuit</head> breaker,
which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs,
will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures
contract; the one-day limit now is 50 index points.

The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to
decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws.  Already,
local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate
cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion
demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services, an
abortion clinic in St. Louis.  The protesters said their actions were
justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children.  Under a 1981
Missouri law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may
offer a defense that their actions were justified ``as an emergency measure
to avoid an imminent public or private injury.'' Relying on the preamble's
statement that a fetus is an unborn child, the two St. Louis County
<head>Circuit</head> Court judges in August accepted the
justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives.

While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday, the volume was still well
within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can
handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash.
The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were
n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day.
Despite traders 'complaints, Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago

These seem to have the curious property that, although they can move fairly freely within a hadron, it appears to be impossible to obtain just one quark on its own; they always come either in groups of three (like the proton or neutron) or in pairs consisting of a quark and antiquark (like the pi meson).
To explain this, quarks were endowed with an attribute called color.
It should be emphasized that this has nothing to do with our normal perception of color; quarks are far too small to be seen by visible light.
It is merely a convenient name.
The idea is that quarks come in three colors &mdash; red, green, and blue &mdash;; but that any isolated bound state, such as a hadron, has to be <head>colorless</head> , either a combination of red, green, and blue like the [pb] proton, or a mixture of red and antired, green and antigreen, and blue and antiblue, like the pi meson.

The intertwining of the thin, twisted worms produces an appearance similar to that of cotton wool.
Microscopic: A small but distinct cephalic vesicle is [gap] [pb] [gap] [pb] [gap] present (Fig. 18).
The spicules are long and slender with fused tips.
In all except N. battus the male has two sets of parallel rays in each of the main bursal lobes; the female has a truncate tail with a small spine, and the egg is large, ovoid and <head>colourless</head> (Fig. 18) and twice the size of the typical trichostrongyle egg. [/p] [caption]

A consequence of the renormalization procedure is that the effective coupling constant of the theory depends on the energy at which it is measured and decreases to zero at very high energies.
This phenomenon is known as asymptotic freedom.
It means that quarks inside a hadron behave almost like free particles in high-energy collisions, so that their perturbations can be treated successfully by perturbation theory.
The predictions of perturbation theory are in reasonable qualitative agreement with observation, but one cannot yet really claim that the theory has been experimentally verified.
At low energies the effective coupling constant becomes very large and perturbation theory breaks down.
It is hoped that this &bquo;infrared slavery&equo; will explain why quarks are always confined in <head>colorless</head> bound states, but so far no one has been able to demonstrate this really convincingly. [/p] [p]

At a time when the rivalry between Rangers and Celtic was rising to a new level of competitiveness, Baxter turned tradition on its head, and befriended a group of like minded Celtic players.
Although the more [corr] bigoted [/corr] supporters resented his corrosive friendship, the blue and the green frequently enjoyed nights out at Hampden Bowling Alley divided in the minds of Glasgow by religion but united in their common interest in Bacardi and blondes. [ptr][/p] [caption]

After a morning pretending to train hard, Baxter would lead a stream of Ibrox reprobates to his St Enoch's lair.
By his own admission, football and fly moves had to be executed with equal style.

The rest of the cabinet was still reluctant to commit the taxpayer, [pb] but it was ready to take seriously a scheme put up by Lionel Rothschild for an international trust fund.
The idea was that the leading countries on the Evian Committee would join in promoting a public subscription of &pound;20 million, of which &pound;5 million was to be raised in London.
Revealing a touching faith in the stability of money, Rothschild suggested that no interest would be due on the loan but that the capital would be repaid after forty years.
To start the ball rolling, the government was asked to contribute &pound;1 million. [/p] [p]
Opposition came from the Treasury ministers who objected to a handout of a <head>cool</head>million as a near sacrilegious attack on the principle of sound finance, and from the Foreign Secretary who had no faith at all in the capacity of the Evian Committee to agree on joint action.

Much over-played these days, on the other hand, is the [hi]Rodrigo [/hi] [hi]Concierto de Aranjuez [/hi] which turns up along with the [hi]Five Preludes [/hi] for solo guitar by [hi]Villa-Lobos [/hi], and his lyrical [hi]Concerto [/hi] for guitar and small orchestra ( [ptr].
The soloist throughout is the estimable Norbert Kraft, and this label's predilection for Canadian ensembles introduces us this time to the Winnipeg SO under Kazuhiro Koizumi.
With an appropriately warmer acoustic than some of the other recordings in this series, these are sound and generally idiomatic performances which can hold their own with their rivals in this price range.
I might have wished for a little less detachment in the Rodrigo (the [hi]adagio [/hi] in particular is rather <head>cool</head> ), but the Villa-Lobos offerings suit Kraft down to the ground.

A lot of Earth's creatures, of course, are neither large nor live in tropical climes, and the energy costs of endothermy are not necessarily so high.
Let us look first at insects, which are particularly vulnerable to extremes of temperature.
When the weather is very cold they cannot fly at all, but can warm themselves by deflecting their wings at right angles to the Sun (as do, for example, locusts).
Such would be a [hi]behavioural [/hi] response.
And at temperatures of 40&deg;C plus, the insect can orient itself parallel to the Sun's rays to reduce the amount of body surface facing the Sun.
It can also lever its legs further off the ground, or it can climb vegetation to reduce thermal ground conductivity. [/p] [p]
At the same time it can exploit the low thermal conductivity of the air; i.e. the way the temperature of the air itself is neither as hot nor as <head>cool</head>as the land surface.

Trim off their leaves, and then spread the roots between layers of moist sand or dry sawdust, placing the largest roots at the bottom as these keep longest.
Beetroot is always better stored in this way after its leaves have been twisted off.
You should never wash roots before storing, but always gently rub off any loose soil. [/p] [p]
Apples should be picked carefully and graded so that the smallest and largest are used first, and medium-sized fruit is saved for storage.
Lay the fruit stem uppermost on shelves or in shallow boxes so that they do not touch each other.
Wrap the finest dessert specimens individually, in some newspaper.
Alternatively, store them in perforated polythene bags. [/p] [p]

More generally, Roach has reservations about the direction the music took after bebop &mdash; &bquo;There was a change-over: it went into dance and party music, functioning as an entertaining vehicle rather than an intellectual, enlightening thing&equo; &mdash; and he sees the effects of this slackening of purpose in the playing of a number of later-1980s musicians.
Roach is a busy man: as well as continuing work with his quartet (currently touring the UK), his double quartet, a percussion ensemble known as M'Boom and a forthcoming collaboration on a play about the Harlem Renaissance, he's also involved with New York rappers in a project called From Bebop to Hiphop and Then There's Max.

Timing is critical: many meetings are marred by going on and on.
Your audience must know that you finished on time, without knowing [hi]how [/hi] you did it.
Plan the schedule as a whole, and in detail, and write down exact timings.
Always finish on time, unless there is a very good reason to overrun.
Be flexible with the details so that if you are getting behind you can trim the programme.
Brief your participants that you will be conducting the meeting this way and expect their co-operation.
Leave them wanting more is a good piece of showbusiness advice.
If people leave feeling it was good but rather long, you have failed.

After meeting Mr Modrow, Mr Mitterrand travelled to Leipzig in recognition of its leading role in East Germany's peaceful revolution.
At the Karl-Marx University, the oldest in East Germany, he held an animated and good-humoured discussion with 450 students. [/p] [p]
They were interested in learning about the opportunities for French involvement in rebuilding the East German economy, but asked how Mr Mitterrand felt about Germans, as a former prisoner of war. [/p] [p]
Mr Mitterrand praised the people of Leipzig for &bquo;having written the history of Europe and Germany in the last few weeks&equo;.
The speed of change was such that it had become difficult to keep up with developments of which perhaps &bquo;we have not yet seen the end&equo;.
But he appealed to the students to contain their passion and to show a measure of reason.
&bquo;If you want peace it is important to stay <head>cool</head> .&equo; [/p] [p]

When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and
the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and
De Beers.  Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De
Beers's stingy approval.  The mining zone has thus remained one of the most
desolate places in Africa.  Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving
diamonds are n't forever.  Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely
corporate oasis of 9,000 residents.  Jackals roam the streets at night, and
gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert
to drink from water sprinklers.  On most days, the desert's heat and the

The main details of the off-farm jobs are outlined in Table 14 below. [gap] [pb] [/p] [p]
In Table 15 the types of employment off the farm are listed.
The variety of employment was greater with the availability of local industries often the deciding factor. [gap] [/p] [p]
Away from the big employers most of the part-time farmers found employment with small rural businesses.
One advantage of this was that the employer or manager was often a part-time farmer/crofter himself and was therefore more understanding of requests for days off or late arrivals in the morning.
Twenty-five percent had jobs directly related to farming and a further 11% had constant contact with farmers.

When you know what you are trying to convey, then you think about the best possible or the most exciting or exhilarating way of communicating this.
You then put another layer of filters on, which is that if you have got to choose, you choose content areas which are very important to Britain, or you choose content areas which the camera can communicate best.
That was the other brilliant thing that Jeremy did.
I went through these areas that I wanted to work in and I argued with Jeremy that we hadn't allowed for &bquo;things visual&equo;, that we had a visual medium, that Britain was profoundly under-educated visually, so that we should actually use television for visual education and he fell for this.

However, you might quite easily eat slightly too much (an intake amounting to 500 calories) each day.
Over 30 days this is 30 x 500 = 15000 calories in excess.
This would be 4lb (just under 2 kg) of fat added to your body; you would be putting on around 1 lb.
(0.4 kg) of fat a week.
If you do not weigh yourself for a month, finding a 4 lb (about 2 kg) gain might be something of a surprise.
If you do not weigh for a year and you eat just an extra 500 calories each day during that time, you will have put on a full 45 lb (21.8 kg); rather a nasty shock!
Generally, therefore, we recommend that you weigh yourself each day.
You will not see vast amounts of fat lost in a <head>day</head> , but you will come to understand how your behaviour relates to your body weight, and you will also avoid getting a horrendous shock when you step on the scales.

For you as writer, this entails looking so hard at the world you write about that you begin to feel the minute, imperceptible movements within it and learn to give them their most appropriate names.
Notice, for example, in the sentences quoted above, how Marquez uses the verb &bquo;waking [pb] 34 CREATIVE WRITING up&equo; before the object &bquo;souls&equo;.

Those verbs, though roughly appropriate, evoke no tingle of recognition in the reader: they are flat, inert.
In &bquo;waking up their souls&equo; Marquez cuts straight to the heart of our earliest desires: to rise from the dead and be reunited with the souls of our lost ones, our dead forebears.

The same is done when religion is reduced to ethics, or treated simply as a movement within history, to be explained and defended, or even proved, by historical research and demonstration.
The encounter between time and eternity cannot be fitted into either pattern of interpretation.
Finally, &bquo;Christendom&equo; itself has betrayed Jesus by domesticating him as if he were the possession of the church, and by making faith the acceptance of formulae and practices hallowed by the authority of the past.
This dissolves the central paradox which is of the very essence of faith, and turns faith itself into an inheritance rather than a permanent passion of risk, commitment and obedience. [/p] [p]

Tommy's bus was the very first form of public transport that I encountered because he came every Wednesday to the head of the dale to take us to Barnard Castle. [/p] [p]
The bus held about twenty people, but it carried all manner of other things.
I have seen poultry and rabbits and large baskets of butter and eggs sharing seats down to Barnard Castle.
I think the fare in later years was half a crown return, and he would park up near the Post Office, so that people could come and leave their shopping with him instead of humping it about the streets.
The return journey was supposed to start at half past three but there would always be a few people missing.
But Tommy was so good natured about everything and he would sally forth and start asking people where his strays might be.
Sometimes the bus didn't set off until nearly four o'clock.
One <head>day</head> Tommy had to let someone else drive and that man set off at three-thirty prompt.

The Government's share shop initiative at the time of the second British Telecom issue brought cheaper dealing for the smaller investor, with charges of no more than 1.5 per cent or &pound;15 minimum.
Dealing costs continue to fall although share shop services are still not universal among banks and building societies.
The only society with its own stockbroking arm, Norwich and Peterborough, has pioneered user-friendly share dealing over the past five years.
Its most recent offer is an instant settlement selling service, which allows customers and non-customers to get cash on the spot when selling shares worth up to &pound;5,000.
It is available through only two branches of N &amp; P stockbroker Waters Lunniss, but the plan is to extend the service to all 63 East Anglian branches.
Charges are higher than for the society's standard dealing system because the stockbroker cannot itself be paid on the deal until the end of the stock exchange account, an average of 10 <head>days</head> ' delay.

Our present rules for its determination (see Appendix 3), as set out in the [hi]Book of Common Prayer [/hi], follow the Roman tradition whereby Easter Day is the first Sunday after the first full moon following (or on) 21 March.
But if full moon occurs [pb] on a Sunday then Easter Day is the following Sunday.
The reason for this was to avoid concurrence with the Jewish Passover.
(The expression &bquo;full moon&equo; means the fourteenth day of the moon reckoned from its first appearance.)
The Celtic Church, founded in the sixth century by St Columba with the aid of Irish-trained monks, followed Rome in always celebrating Easter on a Sunday, unlike the eastern Churches; but owing to its remoteness the Celtic Church experienced difficulty in being kept fully informed of doctrinal and other changes decided on in Rome.

Vologsky sat in the cockpit of the Foxbat, vaguely aware that his mind and body were strangely uncoordinated.
Physically, he was stiff and tense, the muscles in his back and shoulders resisting the comforting embrace of the padded flight couch.
There was a dull pain in his lower jaw, from hours of teeth-clenching, and the fingers of his right hand flexed and unflexed spasmodically, like those of an elderly arthritic. [/p] [p]
Despite all this, his mind was dull, dead, vacuous.
His brain functioned, but on a detached, robotic level.
The vital senses, sight, hearing, touch, responded perfectly.
Yet all incoming data was rejected as soon as it had been acted upon.
Apart from pure reflex, there was no memory, no thought, no feeling.
Vologsky was like a zombie, existing on the outermost fringe of sentient life. [/p] [p]

You must now determine what financial help you need (including Government subsidies for such things as new buildings, fencing, hedging, hill cattle, and sheep), what it will cost, and how it is to be repaid.
A detailed planning budget for both capital and operating accounts must now be prepared not only to give you the information you require for your own plans, but also as the main evidence to persuade the Bank Manager to finance your endeavours. [/p] [p]

Everyone has a story to tell about him. [/p] [p]
Sam was a complete countryman, with a pronounced affinity with nature in all its forms.
In a sense, he could charm the birds from the trees, because he adopted and tamed a variety of wildlife.
His musical ability &mdash; and he was entirely self-taught &mdash; enlivened the dale for many a year and even reached the ears of the outside world when he was talent-spotted by the BBC.

Every evening K&amacr;li spread a new layer of pine-needles in the stable as bedding for the cattle.
I'd often watched her carrying them from the pile outside, spreading them out, fluffing them up.
At night the stable was always warm and dry, smelling of pine and the grassy breath of animals; in the mornings it was damp and ammoniac. [/p] [p]
The stable was mucked out properly only once a year, in winter.
Sometimes fresh cow-dung would be collected for plastering the house, for rituals, or for sealing the clay fermentation jars.
Otherwise the shit and piss were left and, day after day, the soiled bedding was trampled down and compressed.
After a year it was so hard that Chola and Mina had to hack it out with adzes.

Larkin has told how Lawrence was one of his favourite novelists when he was young, along with Isherwood, Maugham and Waugh, and many in and after the Second World War were to ponder the strange, radical genius of famed humility of social origin and ambiguous political stance who had helped keep the realistic spirit alive and potent in an age when its intellectual prestige stood low.
&bquo;A work must enact its own meaning&equo; and &bquo;Never trust the teller, trust the tale&equo; &mdash; such Lawrentian tags, garbled as they may have been from the writings of the Master, could inspire and cheer the literate young of the 1940s.
Lawrence's rising reputation in the years after his death made the critical shift back to realism easier.

So the arrangements were made with the White Star line and unbeknown to Nellie, Liam eventually did get two reservations on the new ship, which was brought down from Liverpool to Southampton, where most of the passengers got on, and then to Cherbourg to pick up some more and finally to Queenstown before crossing the Atlantic to New York.
Liam thought it would be best to join the Irish passengers at the latter port of call.
It would save time and a little bit of money.
Not that money seemed to be a problem.
He didn't know where his father got it from, but there was plenty of it.
So who was Liam to worry?

The key features section at the beginning of this chapter emphasised the need for banks to attract deposits to fund their euro-loan book.
Medium-term loans are to a large extent funded by short-term deposits which have to be repaid and then re-borrowed on a continuous basis.
This, as was pointed out, necessitates the use of roll-over dates in loan agreements to deal with fluctuations in the interest cost of funds. [/p] [p]
If deposits are renewed at shorter time intervals than the loan roll-over dates (mostly six months), a bank might increase its profits, as seven day deposit funds are usually cheaper than six month funds.
This is known as trading in maturities, but, however, it does involve an element of risk for a bank.
If during a six month funding operation, seven <head>day</head> money suddenly becomes more expensive due to higher money market interest rates, then a loss might be incurred.

During the sixteenth century the Brydges bought up the neighbouring estate belonging to the Garways (now called Garnstone), and at the height of their affluence James Brydges married Jane Blount and built The Ley exactly as you see it today.
James and Joan had three sons, one of whom became a major in Charles II's army and drowned in the river at Pershore.
Thomas, his elder brother, was fined as a recusant in 1646, and little by little the Brydges' fortune dwindled.

Fortunately, there is a battery of leftist anti-smoking arguments to buttress flagging resolve, which the rightwinger can't call upon.
Because smoking is, in fact, the cleverest, the most fiendish, the ultimate of all capitalist con-tricks.
Capitalism specialises in producing useless things, but cigarettes really are the absolute acme of uselessness.
The pleasure smoking brings is simply the satisfaction of a craving that, if one didn't smoke, one wouldn't have in the first place.
As well buy a packet of itching powder and a backscratcher, if that's the kind of satisfaction you want.

their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly
to maintain a stable market.  However, in interviews later, both ministers
stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the
production capacity and reserves of each member.  Under that approach,
countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any
future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the
current system.  ``If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your

Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell.  That
makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of
price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline
over the next year or so.  Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual
returns if they are right.  But they will have disappointing returns or
even losses if interest rates rise instead.  Bond resale prices, and thus
fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.  The price

If he committed the crime under an insane delusion, his liability depends on the question whether he would have been liable had the facts been as he imagined them to be.
But uncontrollable impulse, caused by mental defect, is not at present accepted as exempting from criminal liability, except that it may serve to reduce murder to manslaughter (see pp. 167&ndash;8).
When a jury is satisfied that the act was committed, but that at the time the accused was so insane as not to be legally responsible, it brings in a special verdict of &bquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&equo;, though the accused is then ordered to be detained during the &bquo;Queen's pleasure&equo;.

Take the case of Shanaz Begum.
In March 1977, at the age of sixteen, she had come from her village in a remote part of Pakistan to marry a cousin who had settled in Britain for many years.
When she arrived at Heathrow airport, Immigration Officers interrogated her.
They claimed that she was not yet sixteen and so could not marry and hence had no right to be here.
She was taken to Harmondsworth detention centre and locked up.
She had been there about a week when I learnt of her arrival through a friend and went to visit her.
Her relations were keen that I should meet her, perhaps because they hoped in desperation that I might be able to help her.
Unfortunately I could do nothing at all. [/p] [p]

Lord Lane said it would be unlawful to detain a child &bquo;for such period or periods or in such circumstances as to take it outside the realm of reasonable parental discipline&equo;.

All the superintendent must have are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence is a serious arrestable one; this safeguard, therefore, is obviated where the police think one of these vague and undefined consequences might occur.
The second safeguard is even less commendable.
This is the requirement that the investigation be conducted diligently and expeditiously &mdash; hardly worth putting in the statute, easily reduced to an empty formula, and unlikely significantly to assist the suspect.
Finally, the twenty-four hours of detention do not have to have produced one jot of evidence to justify their continuation; it is enough that the police want to obtain such evidence by further questioning.
The desire to persist in interrogation is a valid reason for keeping a suspect in custody for thirty-six hours and indeed beyond.
For the police may apply to a magistrates' court which can issue a &bquo;warrant of further <head>detention</head> &equo; if it reasonably believes this course of action to be justified.

A report by the Nature Conservancy Council has revealed that the Norfolk Broads are being devastated by modern farming methods despite government measures intended to preserve the area.
The report's conclusions are particularly embarrassing to the government as the Broads have been regarded as a test for its conservation commitment.
In 1988, they were given National Park status by a special Act of Parliament.
NCC officials suspect farmers are using excessive amounts of fertilizer, even though the Broads are located within&quot; environmentally sensitive areas&quot; (ESAs), where farmers are paid to use less intensive farming practices.
Much of the pollution is caused by a backlog of fertilizers, built up over the last 30 years, seeping into the groundwater which feeds many of the dykes.
Contamination will continue even if fertilizers are discontinued.
Damage has extended into the <head>dykes</head> which run between the grazing marshes.

That isn't particularly important in itself, but it does illustrate some of the difficulties involved in dealing with volcanoes. [/p] [p]
Let's leave that problem, though, and look at a few of the more important kinds of places in which eruptions occur, relative to a preexisting volcano. [/p] [p]
First, all the activity may be confined to the summit crater at the top of the volcano, just where one might expect it to be. [/p] [p]
Second, it's possible for some explosive activity to take place in the summit crater, but for most of the lava to be erupted quietly from a vent or fissure on the flanks of the volcano. [/p] [p]
Third, there may be very little activity at the summit crater, but the feeder pipe (usually a <head>dyke</head> ) may branch off and most of the eruption may take place on the flanks of the volcano, with a small cone being built up, and lavas emerging from it.

Buried fractures of this type are believed to occur as a natural consequence of within-edifice strain at intraplate volcanoes, and void regions have been postulated within the Kilauean rift zone.
Here, with several closely spaced data we are able to model a previously void region (Fig. 3) and find that it extends at least 3km laterally and 1km vertically.
The model is most sensitive to the lateral extent of the dyke and to its upper surface.
Because no seismic sources have been detected above sea level in the whole period of observation, we conclude that the fractured region and possibly the intrusion also extend down below sea level. [/p] [p]

The thermal history of the South Mountains Granodiorite, provided by isotopic (U-Pb zircon, [hi]40 [/hi] Ar/ [hi]39 [/hi] Ar hornblende, K-Ar biotite) and fission-track (apatite) age determinations, indicates rapid cooling of 260&deg;CMyr [hi]-1 [/hi] (from 800 to 300&deg;C) between 22 and 20Myr ago, followed by slower cooling of 73&deg;CMyr [hi]-1 [/hi] (from 300 to 100&deg;C) between 20 and 17Myr (ref. 24).
Mylonitization of footwall granitic intrusions (Tsm and Ttp) began shortly after crystallization (22Myr) [hi], 19,24 [/hi].
Rapid cooling between 22 and 20Myr reflects both uplift during ductile phases of extensional deformation and ambient cooling of the granitic intrusions.
We therefore interpret magnetizations of high unblocking temperature and high to moderate coercivity found in undeformed parts of the granitic intrusions (Tsm and Ttp) as having been acquired just before or during mylonitization of structurally higher rocks.
Felsic <head>dykes</head> that cut strongly mylonitized portions of the granitic intrusions (Tsm and Ttp) are only weakly mylonitized.

Precambrian rocks at least 100m away from the Telegraph Pass granite contact are of normal polarity (Fig. 3, PC host no. 4).
Contact relationships 1 and 2 of Fig. 3 suggest that magnetizations carried by magnetite in South Mountains granodiorite and microdiorite dykes are primary TRMs.
Contact relationships 3 and 4 of Fig. 3 suggest that hematite in the Telegraph Pass granite and felsic dykes is of high-temperature TCRM origin, with remanence acquisition occurring early in the cooling history of these intrusions.
This hematite is most likely to have been formed during synkinematic circulation of moderate temperature (600&deg;C) magmatic fluids.

The magnitude of footwall tilting is determined by comparing observed data (either primary thermoremanent magnetizations, TRMs, or high-temperature thermochemical magnetizations, TCRMs, acquired early in the cooling history of the intrusions) with expected, time-averaged directions of similar age.
Several palaeomagnetic studies in the Basin and Range province have focused on vertical axis rotation and on tilting of near-surface hanging wall rocks above master [corr] detachment [/corr] faults.
Here, in contrast, we focus on horizontal axis tilting of mid-crustal footwall rocks beneath a master detachment fault. [/p] [p]

STONEHENGE [p]
Stonehenge is a unique and powerful prehistoric monument started over 5000 years ago on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.
The largest stones weigh over 50 tons apiece and some of the smaller ones were transported to the site from over 100 miles away.
The neolithic builders were highly accurate, curving the stone lintels to follow the circumference of a circle and aligning the stones with the exact positions of the midwinter and midsummer sun.
What was the original purpose of the site?
Possibly for ceremonies marking the annual seasons but no one can be sure.
This World Heritage Site remains a mystery. [/p] [p]

Despite early snowfalls throughout the Alps, the best way to ensure good snow for your holiday is to aim high &mdash; especially if you are going in March or later.
Resorts with plenty of skiing over 2,000 metres and, preferably, with a glacier, are generally snow sure.
These include, for example, Zermatt, Saas Fee and Verbier in Switzerland; Val d'Isere, Tignes, Les Arcs and Les Deux Alpes in France; Zell am See (and Kaprun), Hintertux and Solden in Austria. [/p] [p]
There are also lower resorts with especially good snow records such as up-market Lech and Zurs in Austria and duty-free Livigno in Italy.

The university authorities encouraged this novel development and three students were eventually elected to the county congress.

While waiting for these elements to become commercially viable partly accounts for the delay, IBM also has reason to be cautious about allowing its mainframe customers to run existing transaction processing applications on smaller &mdash; and far cheaper &mdash; RS/6000s.

One property of a context is the colour used to display material within that context.

Colours can be defined in a relative way, e.g. 20% redder than the containing colour.

This was due to inadequate planning for maximum utilization of reserves, over-exploitation of existing mines, poor safety standards, lack of new exploration and poor equipment.
One way around the problem is joint developments with foreign partners.
A good example is the &dollar;600 million joint venture with Occidental Petroleum to develop what could be the world's largest open-cast coal mine.
The plan involves a 15 million tonne a year strip mine at Antaibao in the Pingshuo district of Shanxi province, 500 km west of Peking.
The intention seems to be to export the mine's coal &mdash; most of it to Japan. [/p] [p]

Historic pub interiors, as well as pub exteriors, are vital and irreplaceable elements of our cultural and social heritage.

At present there are less than ten laboratories in Britain that can isolate the organism, and most of these are working as research units rather than as service units prepared to isolate chlamydia as part of the standard diagnostic screening that should be available.
Although there are laboratories in Europe and the United States that can grow chlamydia, again they are working as research rather than service units.
It can be calculated that during 1979, 18 000 women will attend clinics in England suffering from chlamydial infection, which they have no hope of getting diagnosed and therefore treated.
These women are at risk of developing salpingitis, of giving birth to babies with eye infections and of passing the infection on to their sexual partner in the form of NSU.
It can be seen, then, that we are dealing with a condition that is some two or three times as common as gonorrhoea, for which an organism is implicated and can be grown in perhaps 50 per cent of cases; and yet there are no <head>facilities</head> , generally, for its isolation.

However, the versatile EQ and the additional power of the bass boost make it easy to fill out the sound, and a smooth, mellow tone is little more than a brief twiddle away.
One of the satisfying aspects of a high quality bass sound is that the listener can hear and separate the constituents of the overall tone (a characteristic of top-drawer active EQ systems, which when boosting/cutting your required frequency band manage not to compromise the sound's other components).
The flick switch here is a practical touch, working in a similar fashion to, say, Trace Elliot's &bquo;pre-shape&equo; <head>facility</head> on their amps in providing instant access to a specified sound, in this case a cut-mid sort of slappy sound. [/p] [p]

A &bquo;Confirmed Credit&equo; is one where a second bank (usually one familiar to the exporter) adds it name to the Credit and thereby assumes all the responsibilities of payment mentioned in Article 10.
Confirmation is usually requested where the exporter is unsure of the standing of the foreign bank or is concerned about &bquo;country risk&equo; &mdash; will the country run out of foreign exchange and be unable to pay? [/p] [p]
Exporters, particularly ones who are acting like brokers &mdash; sourcing the goods from outside their own firm, will often try to use the fact that they have a Documentary Credit from a foreign bank in their favour as a way of financing their operation.
They may, for instance, assign the proceeds of a Credit to the bank to gain an increase in overdraft <head>facilities</head> or an exporter will ask his bank to issue a Credit to his supplier &mdash; an arrangement known as a &bquo;Back-to-Back&equo; Credit. [/p] [p]

The feudal bond established in the first place a special relationship between the lord and a man whom we should call a cavalry officer, whom they called a vassal.
It enabled the lord both to recruit a knight and to reward him.
The vassal knelt before his lord, and placed his hands between his: and so became his man.
This was the act of homage.
Then he rose and swore a solemn oath to keep faith, to be true to his lord.
By this act he performed fealty.
These oaths, and the bond they established, had their origin in the relation of lord and follower in the courts of the barbarian chieftains and they had a powerful religious aura, though this did not always prevent them being broken.

A sudden and unprecedented demand for a large number of new executives to accommodate and take full advantage of this growth coincided with a need for technical experts at management level to develop further the new products and technologies stimulated by the demands of war.
At the same time, military service had taken its toll in many American Boardrooms: inevitably, far fewer returned than had originally joined up, their ranks thinned by death on active service, by the desire to stay on in uniform and by retirement. [/p] [p]
The great demand for executive talent brought about by the wealth of opportunities created under the post-war Pax Americana soon exhausted the supply.

The future Empress, Eug&eacute;nie de Guzman, Countess of Teba, had already met her suitor while he was still President of the Republic.
She and her mother, the Countess of Montijo, had been introduced to Louis-Napoleon by means of their acquaintanceship with Princess Mathilde, an introduction which the latter certainly lived to regret.

Mass was usually celebrated by the priest alone; taking no active part in the service, the laity viewed proceedings from behind the rood screen, which separated the nave from the chancel.
None the less, despite this lack of lay involvement there is considerable evidence that the institution was very popular on the eve of the Reformation.
In early sixteenth-century London it was customary for the most pious lay people to rush from church to church in order to be present at as many elevations of the host as possible in a single day.
On the feast of Corpus Christi, crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the consecrated host in procession.
Moreover, in addition to attending these public celebrations of the sacrament, wealthy individuals, guilds, and lay fraternities frequently held masses in their own chapels or on portable altars, and numerous chantry priests celebrated thousands of private masses for the souls of the <head>faithful</head>departed.

[/p] [p]
The remarkably <head>faithful</head>matching of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the shapes of the continents was a great boost to the theory of continental drift, which postulated that Africa and South America had originally formed a supercontinent, which subsequently split up, with the two parts moving away in opposite directions.

After the account of creation and redemption, which despite the variance among intellectual accounts in the past probably has slightly less relevance as a divider at the popular level, the two main variants begin (for popular accounts, see Harris 1972; Leyton 1975).
In the Roman catholic account, Christ appoints Peter to lead the church he has founded.
In the other, the church is founded but taken over early on by the Popes in Rome and by priests who use magic and ritual to gain control of God's [pb] people, thus profaning his divine word.
For the one version, the Reformation is the catastrophe by which half Christendom defects from the church, the church itself remaining intact and <head>faithful</head>to Peter.

According to one theory, held by some psychiatrists, patients may find doctors increasingly unsympathetic to their plight.
This theory has it that, as a breed, doctors like to be masters of every possible situation, and that this may even be a factor in their selection of medicine as a career.
But this, it is claimed, may make them more vulnerable than most to negative emotions when they are shown to be powerless. [/p] [p]

The physical act of training breaks down part of the muscle exercised, and it is during the next 24&ndash;72 hours that the muscles recover and begin to grow.
Your food intake is of prime importance during the rest and recovery stage.
It is no use stimulating muscle growth if your protein intake is insufficient. [/p] [p]
There is no quick and easy way to build muscles, but once you obtain the correct balance between training, rest and recovery, and diet, then your muscles certainly will grow. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Training for speed [/head] [p]
Muscles are made up of fibres which have different mechanical properties, and two of the main groups of fibres are called fast twitch fibres and slow twitch fibres.
The fast twitch fibres have a much higher contraction speed and are associated with dynamic bursts of energy.
The slow twitch fibres react much more slowly and are more resistant to <head>fatigue</head> , producing greater endurance.

Whenever all the reps are completed with some strength still in reserve, then the weight should be increased, never the reps. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Pyramid training [/head] [p]
Another method of repetition training for strength is to use the pyramid system.
Start with 5 reps at 75% of your maximum lift, then increase the weight but decrease the reps to 4.
Do this until 1 lift is performed at 90&ndash;95% of your maximum and then decrease the weight but increase the reps until you are back to 5 reps at 75% again. [/p] [p]
With this system (see table below) 29 reps will be performed, but it is the way they are split up that promotes the development of greater strength.
This type of training is very demanding and rest and food intake are most important.
At least 1 or 2 rest days will be required between training sessions.
Also, you will need to be particularly careful with your diet if you are not to suffer from <head>fatigue</head> .

These tasks appear to be done better at night with a general decline throughout the daytime to lowest values in the early evening.
A second exception to the parallelism between performance and temperature is a more general one.
In stressful circumstances the effects of daily rhythms are &bquo;swamped&equo; by the response of the body to the emergency.
For example, if you smell burning in the middle of the night you will respond immediately and fully, and not bother to &bquo;consult&equo; any body clock to see if you should calm down and be asleep!
This applies to both your physical and mental performance.
It is important, however, to remember that normally we are not stressed and so, particularly in repetitive and boring situations, the effect of our body clock upon mental performance becomes greater. [/p] [p]

A three-and-a-half hour run can be superhuman effort for one person and a slow training run for another.
The simplest rule is to rest until you feel like running again.
My own experience is that the lowest ebb after a very hard run is not the morning after but the morning after that.
You and your body have been through a lot of stressful experiences, both good and bad, and it could be as long as two weeks before you feel like doing anything except the most gently of runs.
Although people do run marathons week after week, I feel that you need at least four weeks, and preferably six, before you can run another one well. [/p] [p]

Any visual task is rendered more difficult and fatiguing if it is undertaken in poor lighting.
Improving the quality of lighting is one of the most effective ways of increasing the effective use of vision, especially when there are problems with sight.

Invariably, training an older horse actually means re-training.
Producing a young horse without problems is difficult.
Their learning curve is steep but this means that they will pick up bad habits and evasions as quickly as correct ways of going.
It is easier for a horse to evade going correctly because correct work is hard work, requiring effort.
Horses are not stupid and they soon grasp how best to avoid hard graft!

This is the most potent and consistent performance shaping factor ever uncovered by psychologists.
It simultaneously promotes motivation and performance.
Knowledge of how well one is doing will not provide the basic motivation in that the performer must care about his performance but if this is established, knowledge of performance is a most vigorous factor in developing and maintaining the will to perform.

Gloucestershire may well have been influenced by this being Walsh's benefit year, a traditionally powerful distraction, and by the fact that he could be thought out of touch, having missed last season due to the West Indies tour. [/p] [p]
Athey, though having been exposed as a poor leader, could also, like Allan Lamb, be considered a good number two.
Glamorgan's reasoning was less clear and because the discarded man is, or was, a candidate for the England captaincy when it becomes vacant next winter, <head>feelings</head> inevitably ran higher. [/p] [p]

Practitioners concerned about suspected or actual abuse of old people will often be perplexed as to the best course of action.
Where carers admit that abuse has occurred, or are fearful that it may, the worker may have the opportunity to work with the carer (and where possible, the old person) on a future strategy.
This may be focused on support to relieve stress, the modification of certain behaviour or interactions, or the need for the parties to separate.
The last is usually to be regretted but there have been occasions when long-standing marital unhappiness was resolved by admission to residential care in the last years.
More often, of course, separation involves a younger carer giving up the role, about which there is often profound ambivalence.
The manner in which people are helped with those confused and painful <head>feelings</head> may have considerable significance for their future mental health. [/p] [p]

He should not have been ashamed of his grandfather, of course, but his upbringing had been pitiful, constantly on the march from one to another of a whole series of &bquo;uncles&equo; &mdash; there were several between his father and the solicitor &mdash; so that he had nothing stable in his life at all.

As in &bquo;Marie Lloyd&equo; the growth of the cinema was juxtaposed against the primitive Melanesian life, so in the play the interest of Peter Quilpe and Celia Coplestone in Hollywood contrasts with the reality of the primitive world for which, eventually, Celia abandons the Hollywood dream.
Unreality and reality continue to cross and recross throughout the play, as do the savage and the sophisticated.
London chatter, beginning with tigers in India, involves themes such as Montenegro peasants, primitive Guardians, libation rituals, and unrest among natives as well as more expected Hampstead material.

He insisted that the world is run by powerful but sick people who control others because they have failed to eroticize their experience in a harmless way. [/p] [p]
A wide range of so-called sexual sicknesses was diagnosed, Instead of masturbation being classified as wrong or harmful, as it had been in Victorian times, it became not only permissible but obligatory by the new standards.
In the US, women were treated for &bquo;masturbatory orgasmic inadequacy,&equo; which would be laughable if it were not both sad and harmfully misleading.

His aim was for a deeper realism than that of the illustrators and photographers who called themselves Realists.
Why then did he admire them, and collect them so avidly?
Partly he was desperate to earn his own living and vindicate his decision to be an artist, and, in spite of everything, to place in front of his father and mother the hard-won gift of his success.
But what attracted him above all else to the magazine illustrators was their subject matter.
It had the kind of social content which stirred him.
It wasn't that he wanted to be more imaginative than them.
His future liberties with techniques were all to do with representation.

David Bohm proposed that consciousness is basically in the &bquo;implicate order&equo; as all matter is, and therefore it is not that consciousness is separate from matter but rather that consciousness manifests in the &bquo;explicate order&equo; as does all matter.
He sees consciousness as a more subtle form of matter and movement and the source of what we perceive both of the external world and of ourselves, our so-called inner processes lying in the non-manifest, pre-physical realm. [/p] [p]
Consciousness or &bquo;life force&equo; is being increasingly seen by Western thinkers as an expression of a higher, more subtle, unseen and therefore unmeasured, spiritual field of force. [/p] [p]
Universal and human consciousness are one and the same in nature, the only difference being that individual consciousness is experienced as limited or restricted in its operation within its physical vehicle.

The problems with unwanted feelings are that they tend to hinder us in the here and now even though the feelings are often associated with past or future events.
Worry and guilt are excellent examples of this.
You worry in the here and now about things in the future which may never happen.
You feel guilty in the here and now about things that happened in the past which you cannot correct.
In both cases the present moment is being spoilt by fretting needlessly over past or future moments. [/p] [p]
What, then, can be done to prevent ( [hi]not [/hi] suppress but actually [hi]prevent [/hi]) unproductive, unwanted feelings?
It is important to be realistic.
The objective is to prevent, or at least nip in the bud, unwanted feelings.

You will then still have enough material with which to create an attractive picture, rather than try to make a suitable design from a few odds and ends. [/p] [p]
The original bouquet for this picture was exceptionally large, so I have not been able to reproduce a life-sized replica but instead have scaled it down to fit into a picture frame.
You may find that you often have to do this, as even a modest wedding bouquet can be too large to fit into a reasonably&rehy;sized picture frame, and if it were reproduced in its original size it could become such a large picture that it would completely dominate any room in which it was hung.
So, a little artistic licence may be called for, and you will have to use your skills to create a bouquet picture that gives the <head>feeling</head> of the wedding flowers without reproducing them exactly. [/p] [p]

The roof was split palm lath, tied and pinned as thatch, then covered with a finely woven matting which made it quite weather-proof.

Time and time again he will charge for the snags which are in range, including some of which you may be unaware, or others you may think are out of range.
Each time you should apply side-strain and try to steer him away from them.
This is no time for delicacy and posing, it is time for strong-arm stuff which would bring looks of admiration from a shark angler and cause a tiddler snatcher to cringe in fear.

Apart from anything else, there is no doubt that Joni's meeting with Berenson gave him access to a circle of wealthy collectors, like Dan Fellows Platt, and scholars and researchers, such as Frederic Mason Perkins.

One of these is technical, the other conceptual.
The technical problem is that of ensuring that the stimulation is of a duration and intensity to be physiologically realistic.
Ten minutes of stimulation at 100 volts in a system that operates on a millisecond timescale and deals in ion currents that generate a few thousandths of a volt is scarcely going to simulate what happens normally in the brain.
The conceptual problem is that of interpreting the effects of localized stimulation in a system that probably deals with patterns of input. [/p] [p]
Stimulation can either be electrical or chemical.
Electrical stimulation is delivered via electrodes, often similar to those used in lesion-making studies.

For example, a typical lineage may result in cell type A giving two cell types B and C, and only C continues to divide to give types D and E. Mutants can result in the substitution of type Z for B; or make the lineage symmetrical &mdash; B now giving D and E; or even generating a stem cell line with B being replaced by A which repeats the pattern of cell divisions and cell differentiation. [/p] [p]
The emphasis on cell lineage in the worm is a little misleading since the implication is that the behaviour of the cells is entirely determined only by the lineage and not by cell signals.
In some cases this is true, [pb] but in other cases it is not.

That he thought this possible is suggested by his comments on Frazer whom he saw not as an investigator of a remote and hence irrelevant past, but as someone whose researches are like Freud's, of apparently universal application, applying not to a particular historical period but to &bquo;the soul&equo;.
Frazer, through setting out to study an essential ritual of the primitive dead, had done what Eliot hoped modern literature, including [hi]Sweeney Agonistes [/hi] would do.
He had become a &bquo;vitalizing&equo; force.
Compared with Freud's, Frazer's work was &bquo;of perhaps greater permanence,, because for Eliot it was neither a collection of data nor a theory.
The absence of speculation is a conscious and deliberate scrupulousness, a positive point of view.
And it is just that: a point of view, a vision, put forward through a <head>fine</head>prose style, that gives the work of Frazer a position above that of other scholars of equal erudition and perhaps greater ingenuity, and which gives him an inevitable and growing influence over the contemporary mind.

During the period from 1560 to 1625, many contemporaries, both inside and outside England, had regarded the English church as a pragmatic, if rather unsatisfactory compromise between two purer denominations.
By the early 1630s, however, some Arminians had begun to argue that the English via media was in fact superior both to Roman Catholicism and the more extreme varieties of continental Protestantism.
Such an outlook is particularly well illustrated by the literary work of the Arminian clergyman, George Herbert.
His poem [hi]The British Church [/hi], for example, displays its author's deep devotion to the English church of the 1630s, which is described as a &bquo;dearest mother&equo;.
He refers to its &bquo;<head>fine</head>aspect in fit array&equo; and &bquo;perfect lineaments and hue both sweet and bright&equo;.

Even in those species that choose a mate that is a bit different but not too different from close kin, other factors are also important.
Qualities such as the physical condition of the member of the opposite sex, the resources it holds and the extent to which it bears characters that have been subject to sexual selection can all affect whether or not it is chosen (see Halliday, 1983).
It would be quite wrong to suggest that the [hi]only [/hi] influence on mate choice is relative familiarity. [/p] [p]
Despite the variety and the complexity, the animal work indicates first and foremost that mate choice can be profoundly influenced by early experience.

In his second novel, [hi]The Inheritors [/hi], Golding has stood so far back from modern historical progress as to imagine the [pb] supersession of innocent, hairy Neanderthalers by &bquo;bone-face men&equo; in a prehistoric age: they wear clothes or, as the primitive eye sees it, they step outside their skins.
No shared knowledge there, but an imaginative leap that stretches realism to the farthest point and yet preserves its characteristic obsession with speech and gesture.
The realistic novelist's world is a roomy one, large in space and time.
As Iris Murdoch has remarked in admiration of Dickens and Tolstoy, the great novelist creates a house <head>fit</head>for free character to live in: free, that is, to live lives untrammelled by the allegorical or the stereotypical, to be as quirky, unpredictable, and self-contradicting as beings one knows in a real world.

Morel tried to organize an agitation to press the Government to take a strong line with France, but the UDC's local groups had long since disbanded, and the LNU, which favoured a conciliatory approach to the French, warned its own local groups against agitation. [/p] [p]
Morel s objective was to win the Labour Party for a policy of radically revising the Versailles Treaty.
But when MacDonald formed the first Labour Government in 1924, he brushed aside Morel's claim to the Foreign Office and took the job himself, combining it with the premiership.
In line with his overall political goal of proving that Labour was &bquo;<head>fit</head>to govern&equo;, Macdonald abandoned the visions of democratic diplomacy which had so excited him in 1917 and proceeded to adjust to the reality of a balance of power mediated through the League, helping to resolve the Ruhr crisis by lending his support to the rescheduling, rather than the abolition, of German reparations payments.

The hypothesis states that the form taken by any natural organised object or living thing, whether a crystal or an embryo, is not determined solely or indeed initially by the physical laws at present recognised by science.
Instead, the shape that a crystal first assumes is determined by chance.
Having once formed, it emanates &bquo;morphogenetic fields&equo; that influence the form taken by all other crystals of the same kind: and the fields of each new individual combine to provide a &bquo;morphic resonance&equo;, active across both space and time.

The Netting Operation [/head] [p]
With your preparation and your prospecting complete it then becomes a simple matter of erecting the net in the right place on the night.
Bear in mind that rabbits always net better when they are running downhill, so take advantage of that if possible.
All rabbits flushed from open land are fully exposed.
They panic when driven out into the open and their first thought is to find cover as quickly as they can.
So they pick up full speed and run for cover &mdash; and your net should be carefully positioned so they hit it just before reaching safety.
They become entangled in such a way that it is very rare for any to wriggle <head>free</head> , and while there is ample time to collect them at relative leisure they should nonetheless be collected as quickly as possible. [/p] [p]

There were certainly strong arguments in favour of the course which the King adopted.

Lipid Metabolism [/head] [p]
The major large lipid molecules of plasma &mdash; triglycerides, cholesterol, cholesterol esters and phospholipids &mdash; are predominantly transported by stable complex water-soluble macromolecules, designated lipoproteins.

Without going into the intricacies of Belorussia's fate between 1917 and 1921 (she was occupied in turn by Germans, Poles, and Russians, and there were three successive Soviet governments), a few salient points may serve to show the indifference of all the four nationalities involved to Belorussian national claims.
In 1917 the Belorussian National Committee, [pb] a hotchpotch of indecisive and divided intellectuals, eventually mustered sufficient unity to send demands to Petrograd, only to be nullified by the differing views of the Petrograd- and Moscow-based Belorussian groups (intimations of those wider cultural and political differences between the twin capitals which are taken up in a later chapter).
Abstract theorizing continued in Moscow and Petrograd, unrelated to the practical needs and wishes of the ordinary Belorussian back at home.
As a result, in the first <head>free</head>elections in the spring of 1917 to the [hi]zemstvo [/hi] and municipal Belorussian governments, not a single nationalist representative won any popular support.

At the same time, rural conservative Protestants, especially those from the Irish Presbyterian Church, were attracted to the religious movement.
By far the greatest proportion of those joining the new congregations were Presbyterians and they were mostly from rural areas.
In occupation they were mostly either farmers or people who worked in agriculture-related industries.
In terms of social composition, it is difficult to be more specific because &bquo;farmer&equo; covers a considerable diversity of wealth [pb] and social status.
My impression, based solely on those farmers whom I have met, is that the supporters of Free Presbyterianism tended to be small to medium farmers running family operations with only one or two labourers.

Renin-angiotensin system [/head] [p]
A possible pathological role for the renin-angiotensin system has been proposed.
In normotensive and hypertensive diabetics without evidence of nephropathy both raised and normal levels of plasma renin activity have been found ( [sic] Christleib [/sic] et al, 1976; De Chatel et al, 1977; Burden &amp; Thursten, 1979).
Although studies have revealed that only a small subgroup of such diabetics have reduced plasma renin, in those with nephropathy both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone tend to be decreased (Christlieb, 1978).
This may be due to a reduction of <head>free</head>water clearance resulting in elevation of the blood volume and suppression of renin while the osmotic effect of hyperglycaemia may further exacerbate the problem.

Her spine was so tense, her shoulders so rigid, that she ached all over and that empty and gnawing pain in her stomach seemed to increase in severity as dusk approached and the hour when son and husband would return grew closer.
She vomited, but had nothing except bile to bring up, a sweat thickened on her forehead which no amount of wiping away would banish.
She knew little moans of anguish were escaping her, whimperings such as a dog might give.
She walked out of the cottage where she and Pilade were lodged in charge of Mr Landor and along the road to Siena so that she might see them approach before anyone.
Pilade was asleep, leaving her arms <head>free</head>for the precious embrace she longed for.

With the threat of war approaching, a Cadet Corps was formed and my Sunday school teacher provided the fifteen shillings necessary for the purchase of a second-hand uniform, which had to be cut down to boy's size.
The annual camp for secondary schools Cadet Corps gave me my first holiday away from home, but I was so homesick that a fortnight seemed an impossibly long time before I could get back to my parents and family.
For a time we small cadets guarded railway bridges, with empty carbines, but were more frightened of the dark than of possible German invaders.

Positivist criminology has failed in its avowed intention to replace classical criminology with an objective, scientific model of the causes and treatment of crime.
It has failed to establish clear-cut causal variables that differentiate offenders from non-offenders, and failed to specify effective individualised treatment programmes.
The best it has been able to achieve is loose, probabilistic associations which sometimes, in all but the terminology used, have treated individual offenders as at least partially <head>free</head> , rational and choice-making (and in so doing, has to some extent converged with classical criminology).

Though not entirely restricted to Friends, it was an approach particularly appealing to people in whom quietist instincts remained strong both before and after the direct political involvement exemplified by the election of Joseph Pease to parliament in 1832.
One interpretation of the intermittent energy which Joseph Sturge put into the free produce movement in the 1840s is that it constituted an attempt by a Friend who had launched out into public and even political life to maintain links with more traditionally quietist brethren who none the less looked for greater perfection in the world.

As a mechanism for weakening the slave trade, British colonial slavery and American slavery, the abstention from slave-grown produce was marginal in giving reality to abolitionist arguments about the &bquo;impolicy&equo; of the trade and in no way qualified, despite the evidence it provided, the later reflexive ideological commitment of abolitionists to the superior efficiency of <head>free</head>labour.

THIS large &mdash; format (22 x 28 cm) book provides the most information about the carbon dioxide problem available in one manageable volume.
It is a multi-author work, organised by the Institute for Energy Analysis of Oak Ridge Universities, and is intended to be part of the broad CO [hi]2 [/hi] programme in the US that has already produced several official reports on different aspects of the problem, and will lead to a comprehensive report in 1985.

It became clear in the operation of the first category that, for example, strong social conscience or interest did not necessarily bring a concomitant skill in criminal advocacy.

Chantler noted, however, in 1952, that &bquo;the current investment review has been even more fantastic than its predecessors if that were possible&equo;, and it was not until 1953 that the Treasury had worked out a new system of investment control.
This led to the partial abandonment of physical controls and a move towards financial disciplines for the nationalised industries.
Ernest Long summarised the change snappily in his note to the Authority's accountant when they were working out the implications in 1954: &bquo;instead of being messed about by the long&rehy;haired boys at the Treasury we are now dealt with by the Finance boys &mdash; and we much prefer it that way&equo;. [/p] [p]
The subjection of the industry to &bquo;financial disciplines&equo; was inevitably at first a slogan rather than a policy.

Hakim, left behind in Frankfurt in October to arrange some sort of deal, ended up with a promise of 1 &frac12; (sic) hostages in exchange for 1,500 TOWs and pressure for the release of 17 terrorists held in Kuwait.
The exchange was approved by Poindexter, apparently after informing the President.

The Americans knew they were being led a dance, but the urge to rescue hostages &mdash; premised on high emotion and some amount of electoral calculation &mdash; drove the policy forward. [/p] [p]

Once the male has the female under his nest, he will embrace her forming a &bquo;U&equo; around her body.
As he gently squeezes, she will release from 5 to 20 eggs which he fertilises.
These float to the surface among the bubbles.
Once the pair have recovered they will embrace several more times.
Eventually there may be well over 100 eggs in the nest. [/p] [p]
The male is usually left in the tank to keep the eggs clean.
These hatch in two days and the fry are free swimming of the 5th day. [/p] [p]

A highly-developed sense of the ridiculous is inimical to the striking of certain musical attitudes; and, while I'm sure mason regards the craft of composition itself with profound seriousness, there are clearly many compositional modes and self images which he's quite unable to invest with the spurious dignity they often demand.
Certainly the taste for parody hasn't deserted him (witness the piano pieces in homage to Scarlatti, Medtner, Alkan, late Liszt [hi]et al [/hi]); nor has his taste for rum titles (such as the choral work [hi]Oil or petrol Marks on a Wet Road are Sometimes held to be Spots where a Rainbow Stood [/hi]).

Originally a mere footpath through fields, Charles II had decided it was a better route to Hampton Court than one to the North, through the village of Knightsbridge.
At this time the King's French gardeners were making extensive improvements to the Palace gardens and frequent inspection was necessary.
The land was therefore made into a coach road, allowing farm labourers and market gardeners access to the fields, but during the reign of George I, this long-established route was closed by the Surveyor General and only a few privileged people were allowed to use it.
Sloane petitioned the Lords Commissioner of H.M.

There are few children who do not experience the death of a much-loved grandparent or pet when they are quite young, and yet so often they are excluded from all the changes that go on at the time of a grandparent's death, as though in some way this will leave them unaffected. [/p] [p]
Children are often not allowed to go to funerals nor allowed to talk or ask questions about the person who has died.
They are often told not to cry &bquo;because it will upset Mummy&equo;.
All this may be done for the best of reasons but it only ensures that children bottle up their feelings as well as their tears, which, as we have seen in previous chapters, can have far-reaching effects.
Grief will find an expression at some time, and if it is not allowed at the time it occurs, then it will be much more difficult to deal with when it is triggered by an event in later life.
To some extent, adults can choose of their own <head>free</head>will whether to deal with their grief or not.

Patten believes that people have to recognize that environmental quality is not a cost-free option and that the way in which energy and transport policies will have to be modified to take account of environmental factors will become an important subject of public debate.
So let us look at an English case which exemplifies some of the practical problems confronting the theorists of sustainable development: Twyford Down (near Winchester) and the route of the M3 motorway in March 1990.
Twyford Down is a much-loved, fiercely defended &bquo;environment&equo; close to a city which values its green spaces.
It is designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty, the exquisite chalk-hill blue butterfly has made its home there and there are Celtic fields and an Iron Age fort.
Here, clearly, was a marvellous opportunity to give Pearce's principles <head>free</head>rein and see what costings they produced. [/p] [p]

The second and later major influence on Barth has been, again by his own admission, that of Borges and he has set on record his admiration for that writer in his most famous article, &bquo;The Literature of Exhaustion&equo; (1967), in which he argues that certain literary forms may be used up and so are no longer available to the writer except as parody.
Partly irritated by critical misreadings of this piece, Barth published in 1979 a &bquo;comparison and corrective&equo; entitled &bquo;The Literature of Replenishment&equo; in which he sees disjunction, etc. as essentially modernistic and seeks a synthesis between modernism and nineteenth-century realism.
Here he elaborates on an argument sketched out a few years earlier, that the label &bquo;postmodern&equo; denoted the quality of being &bquo;<head>free</head>to come to new terms with both realism and anti-realism, linearity and non-linearity, continuity and discontinuity&equo;.

What are the main characteristics of the Suffolk breed of horse?
The first and obvious one is the clearly defined colour.
The colour of the old breed was distinguished by the now obsolete term sorrel &mdash; a name which still remains in many Suffolk inns.
The colour today is chestnut; but there are seven shades of chestnut: the red; the golden; the lemon or yellow; the light, mealy chestnut; the dark; the dull-dark, and lastly the bright chestnut.
The bright chestnut is considered the most characteristic colour and, all other things being equal, the one to be preferred. [/p] [p]
The Suffolk's head is big with a broad forehead, and often with a star on it or a [hi]shim [/hi] or [hi]blaze [/hi] down the face; the neck deep in the collar and tapering to a <head>graceful</head> setting of the head; the shoulders long and muscular and thrown well back at the withers.

The colour is produced by imperfections and impurities in the diamond, for example, a yellow colour results when the diamond contains nitrogen atoms clustered together in equilateral triangles with each nitrogen atom replacing one carbon atom of the perfect diamond (Figure 4).
At these defects the electron orbitals are very different from those found in the perfect regions of the diamond.
The electrons may be excited from one orbital to another, still localised at the nitrogen impurity, by much less energy than is required in the perfect diamond: in fact, blue light has sufficient quantum energy.
Because the diamond is absorbing blue light, it appears yellow in ordinary light. [/p] [p]

In addition to dried beans and pulse vegetables, I stock several varieties of canned beans which are always very popular for salads and quick meals, where there is no time (or the customer forgot!) to soak dried pulses.
I certainly sell more red lentils than any other dried pulse, probably because they are the only variety that does not require soaking before cooking and are therefore the most convenient.

In the language of blazon this is [hi]three piles conjoined in base [/hi] (the charge being so termed, it is said, after the shape of the wooden supports early bridge-builders drove into river beds to support their structures).
This shield design was used by the Earl of Chester, John le Scot [pb] ( [hi]fl [/hi].
1225) as [hi]or three piles gules [/hi] (gold with red spikes), the family of Ridel &mdash; [hi]or three piles sable [/hi] (gold with black spikes), Basset (who succeeded Ridel) [hi]or three piles gules within a bordure sable [/hi] (gold with red spikes all inside a black border), Bryan &mdash; [hi]or three piles azure [/hi] (gold with blue spikes), and Wrottesley &mdash; [hi]or three piles vert [/hi] (gold with <head>green</head>spikes).

Thus, over a long period of time, stone, glass and metals acquire a distinctive patina which the faker must try and imitate.
The patinas on copper alloys were often appreciated in their own right and a study of the patination is central to all authenticity studies.
It is essential to have a good appreciation of the possibilities of recent treatments, such as over-restoration or repatination, so a brief history of patination is given here. [/p] [p]
As far as we know, the ancients intended their metalwork, both artistic and utilitarian, to be kept in a brightly polished metallic state, with the possible exception of special alloys such as Corinthian bronze.
We tend now to think of Classical bronze statuary, for example, as being covered with a fine <head>green</head>or deep brown patina, and moreover that this was their original state.

Technical improvements to the riding qualities of the OMO cars, followed the replacement of the traditional steel springs by rubber suspension.

He had jumped down to open the carriage door for her and Charlotte and the child made to get in.
Albert was talking to them as they waited to leave, and the boy had a large rubber ball that he would insist on throwing about in the compartment.
Charlotte, her eyes on Albert who was taking her attention, asked him rather half-heartedly to desist, but the boy threw the ball out of the window.
It hit the platform fence and ran under the carriage; as quick as a flash the boy darted past Charlotte and Albert and tried to look for it under the wheels.
As Charlotte scrambled out of the carriage the boy was halfway under the carriage; almost beside herself, Charlotte and Albert tried to haul him up.
The driver had seen the <head>green</head>flag and had opened the regulator to ease forward, yelling at Albert to come on.

Transport nevertheless remained a major problem, and as Commandos' equipment for raiding roles did not include those infantryman's delights of defensive wire and mines &mdash; not, that is, in the normal course &mdash; they always had problems in battles of attrition.
Nevertheless, as their story does not follow the usual path of military organisation, it was not particularly surprising to find later commandos coming ashore with anti-tank mines strapped to their equipment.
However, they were not normally set up for the heavy infantryman's tactics of prolonged defence before a steady advance, although they were misused in these roles at times.
They were nimble-footed, lightly equipped for the in-and-out thrust over terrain where others might not be expected to beach or march.
But all the speed of foot is no substitute for an anti-tank gun to beat off armoured attack, &bquo;nor does a <head>Green</head>Beret make you bullet-proof&equo; (again to quote General Moulton). [/p] [p]

Most encounters started in the same way, with a question about the bikes.
&bquo;Why the bikes?&equo;
&bquo;Why do you carry such loads on your back?&equo; was our most popular response.
It's easy to push a bike and it belts downhill.
The truth is that uphill the extra weight made it a little harder than walking, but the weight was not directly on my back, a fact that I appreciated.
We could push our laden bikes at a roughly typical walking pace up passes.
On the flat life was in our favour and we left most walkers behind.
Downhill we were in a different league.
On one occasion, on a 300-metre climb from the spectacular bridge over the H&auml;rrakalou, a <head>green</head> , algae-filled river that drains a huge area of the Sarek National Park, we were accompanied by two fit Dutch lads, who maintained a similar pace.

The answer must be that trying to give values to the environment is an irrelevance.
Perhaps one can produce figures for the amount knocked off property prices by aircraft noise and excessive pollution (as [hi]Blueprint [/hi] suggests, with the backing of figures from American cities), but even here there is room for doubt.
Some of the highest property prices anywhere are in fume-ridden Manhattan and in cleaner but nevertheless congested central Tokyo.
Airports attract hotels and businesses; they employ large numbers of well-paid staff who like to live near their work.
House and land prices tend on the whole to go up rather than down.
There is another problem when it comes to applying market prices to environmental capital: the pieces of <head>green</head>environment that are most treasured by most people are their gardens.

By imposing a general tariff on foreign imports, Britain would be able to open negotiations with the White Dominions for a mutual removal of tariff barriers, drawing them into closer economic ties with the homeland as a first step towards final political federation of the Empire as a whole and the establishment of a supreme representative Imperial Parliament in London.
The primary purpose of Chamberlain's Tariff Reform programme was imperial consolidation.
But it also offered other advantages &mdash; protection of British jobs against cheap foreign imports, and an inflow of customs duties to the Treasury which could be used to pay for the escalating costs of both armaments and social reforms.
As Chamberlain's doctrines swept the Tory rank and file, liberal pacifists feared that Tariff Reform would provide the new imperialism with a level of popular appeal that would make it unstoppable. [/p] [p]

These are the new 14050 style shoes, also known as &bquo;Shockwave&equo;.
According to Vision, they are the &bquo;newest most versatile shoe&equo;, and I'd tend to agree.
They are lower cut, not exactly &bquo;high&equo; tops, but offer thick padding at the ankle and support at the same time.
Combine this with a padded tongue and further support around the lower foot area and you end up with a darn comfy shoe.
Also features speedlace &lsqb;for faster lacing&rsqb;, &bquo;action&equo; leather &lsqb;tougher leather then normal for durability&rsqb; upper, and long lasting sole with <head>grip</head>and feel.

She had now stationed herself directly behind Rupert, and suddenly she extended a hand the size of a tennis racquet and grabbed all the hair on Rupert's head in her fist.
Rupert had a lot of golden-coloured hair.
His mother thought it was beautiful to behold and took a delight in allowing it to grow extra long.
The Trunchbull had as great a dislike for long hair on boys as she had for plaits and pigtails on girls and she was about to show it.
She took a firm <head>grip</head>on Rupert's long golden tresses with her giant hand and then, by raising her muscular right arm, she lifted the helpless boy clean out of his chair and held him aloft. [pb] [/p] [p]

Winter discovered that he could apply a limited amount of control by squeezing Mandarin with his knees, by swinging his body to one [pb] side or the other, and by applying such pressure as he could with the reins on the horse's neck.
He also had the assistance of his rivals, for at the next bend the French jockey Jean Daumas, well aware of the difficulties Winter was in, pushed his mount Taillefer up on Mandarin's outside, and his presence helped keep the British-trained horse on course.
But hurtling towards Winter was the most difficult part of the track, where the course divides into three, and the approach to this junction was not railed.
Winter had to aim Mandarin for the middle course but his mount started wandering off to the left before pressure from the vice-like <head>grip</head>of the jockey's thighs pointed him in the right direction.

What follows is an examination of structure and of how an awareness by the teacher of its significance can help him find the game in the drama. [/p] [div2] [head]
Drama structures [/head] [p]
For the above sub-heading I have deliberately copied from the title of a recent publication by Cecily O'Neill and Alan Lambert (1982), for it is a manual offering guidance to teachers in their planning of projects for drama.
Central to the planning are not clearly defined objectives but clearly defined structures.
The main strength of the book lies in the fact that most of their lesson material is from actual classroom practice.
I shall from time to time use some of their material for further analysis and in order to make clear what I mean by structure. [/p] [p]
The kind of structure the authors mostly discuss is to do with how to move from one dramatic experience into another in a way that tightens the pupils' <head>grip</head>on the central issue.

In that year, Haringey's Labour councillors learned more about heterosexism than they would ever have believed possible, and they have become far more articulate in their defence of lesbian and gay rights than they were at the time of their election.
The council's curriculum working-party on lesbian and gay issues in education produced a thoughtful and well-researched document, [hi]Mirrors Round The Walls &mdash; Reflecting Diversity [/hi], which received none of the media interest experienced by the earlier misinformation.
But what Positive Images might have done, but did not do, was to generate any Left consensus on the family and relationships.
The Left had discovered that more was being expected of them than tolerance, but while the PRG had succeeded in setting an agenda based on fear, hatred and ignorance, Positive Images failed to popularize our own agenda of equality, choice and resistance to oppression.

199 all out meant victory by an innings and 30 runs; it also meant that West Indies had emulated Australia's feat in 1920&ndash;1 and 1921 of recording eight successive Test victories over England.
It seemed that only the weather could stop another blackwash. [/p] [p]
The fourth Test in Trinidad was simply a repeat of the first.
On a pitch of uneven bounce England were put in and shot out before the end of the day for 200, David Smith, Lamb and Botham the only ones to make an impression.
Next day, Thomas, who had had a good tour so far, bowled poorly and paid the price; Botham, by contrast, had had an awful tour, but now he bowled well and took five wickets as a result.
This did not stop West Indies taking a firm <head>grip</head>on the match, as Greenidge reached 5,000 Test runs and Richards 6,000, warming up for his achievement in the next match with 87. 312 all out was hardly the big total they would have [pb] wanted, but it was quite enough.

Ostensibly to recover lost English possessions, Edward's invasion of France followed almost immediately in the wake of Philip's unopposed seizure of the French throne.
King John II succeeded Philip in 1350 and, after a series of English victories during which John was captured and sent back to England, Edward led his army on to Champagne.
In 1359 he attempted to storm Reims in a bid to be crowned king of France in its cathedral.
His attempt failed, but the Treaty of Bretigny was concluded which gave Edward sovereignty over Calais and the whole of Aquitaine, almost a quarter of France.
Content with his achievement, Edward renounced his claim to the French crown. [/p] [p]

If you are replacing someone who is leaving the firm then it is essential to know why they are going.
It may be for a perfectly simple reason, for example a partner may have found a job which entails moving out of the area.
However, it may be because of some problem to do with the job itself or the working conditions.
If there is a problem with the job then, if the criticism is valid, take this into account while working out the new job specification.
Otherwise you may find the next person leaves as well and you will be involved with costly and time-consuming interview procedures again. [/p] [p]

Clubs, Russell wrote, had three main interests: recreation, education, and religion.
Boys, he said, needed &bquo;excitement&equo;, and if they could not get it by legitimate ways then they would &bquo;seek it in mischief and vice&equo;.
The answer to this problem lay in healthy recreation, which meant games, swimming, gymnastics, boxing, indoor games, and, in certain clubs, cycling and country walks.
The notion of education was to be interpreted in the widest sense of the word to include physical, moral, and mental training.
Religion was also to be given a broad interpretation.
Some of the older clubs were narrowly evangelical, but Russell wanted to see religion used &bquo;to comprehend all the impalpable influences which give a club a <head>grip</head>on its boys and tend to awaken their higher nature or further their spiritual development&equo;.

For all your sound recording, take care to ensure that your microphone leads and audio connections are electrically sound and properly screened from hum pick-up, so that the signal arrives at the camcorder in the best possible condition.
Keep the length of extension leads as short as you can to reduce the risk of them picking up stray radiations from nearby electrical appliances and short wave broadcasts such as taxi radio messages.
Do not operate microphones, mixers or other such equipment in close proximity to television sets and loudspeakers as these emit magnetic fields which can adversely affect the working of your audio systems. [/p] [p]

At the forefront is a traction control system.
The system has what Mitsubishi claims to be the world's first &bquo;trace&equo; control device on a production car, which operates to prevent understeer from building up, allowing the driver safely to negotiate a bend. [/p] [p]
Trace is designed principally for high-friction, metalled roads, where it predicts probable cornering forces based on the steering angle, engine speed and amount of grip available.
It then adjusts the engine speed accordingly via second throttle. [/p] [p]
There is also a slippage control which automatically cuts power if the wheels begin to spin under harsh acceleration.
All this is linked to four-wheel steering and ESC adaptive suspension, which adjusts its settings to limit body roll and optimise tyre <head>grip</head>during cornering.

If such notions did not worry Hong Kong before Tiananmen, they ought not to worry it now.
China maintains the same professed intentions.
The Basic Law will still be enacted, promising a panoply of rights and freedoms for 50 years beyond 1997.
But the Chinese Constitution contains all sorts of promises, too &mdash; so many that it could probably have been construed to forbid the People's Liberation Army from shooting dead hundreds of unarmed civilians, and to prohibit the arbitrary arrest, summary trial or execution of thousands more.
Tiananmen demonstrated what most people in Hong Kong well knew, but preferred not to admit: that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party can and will do absolutely anything, however brutal and illegal, to further their <head>grip</head>on power.

For the purposes of the Conservative Party conference, it was enough that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer denied the existence of an alternative economic strategy.
The Labour Party's lead in the polls and the doubts which the Conservatives themselves cannot help feeling about the state of the economy, both made the audience in the Winter Gardens anxious to demonstrate unity by giving standing ovations to the architects of the Government's economic policy. [/p] [p]
The wider, less devoted audience in the country will not be so ready to express approval.
Several weaknesses undermine the Government's position.
The first is that the Prime Minister has always said she regards the fight against inflation as paramount.

Published reports rarely comment on evidence for the function of domestic pottery, and unlike studies of later medieval pottery the presence or absence of sooting on the vessels' surfaces is not always commented on.
Large domestic pots at West Stow had been given a thin coating of day on the outside after they had been fired; this layer is usually slightly reddened as a result of partial firing (West 1985, p. 129).
Leeds described coarse vessels, many tempered with organic material, found within sunken buildings at Sutton Courtenay as &bquo;cooking-pots&equo;, which were associated with fire-reddened pebbles.
While the association may not be relevant to the function of the pottery, he interpreted the stones as pot&rehy;boilers (1936, p. 24).
<head>Hearths</head>are a fairly common feature in a proportion of such buildings and Leeds also describes some pits as being for cooking.

It is sufficient at this point to remind ourselves of Bernard Rollin's argument, in defence of Rawls, that the interests of infants, imbeciles, and animals, will be included in the scope of those of the moral agent with moral personality.
The potentiality of young children must be a concern of any community that looks to the future.
The tribeswoman will doubtless have deep feelings for her children and be ambitious for [pb] their success in life, and affection and admiration for animals has had a place in all societies, even in that of Ancient Rome.
It was pointed out, in Chapter 1, that such a defence will have conservative implications since it puts the moral patients at the mercy of those interests, whatever they might be, that prevail amongst moral agents in a society.
Senescent Eskimos, for example, might be thought to have had a raw deal if the stories of the banishment from the familial <head>hearth</head>of those unfit to hunt and fish are to be believed.

None of these military and diplomatic successes for Charles V was in itself a reason for the renewal of war in 1369, though they [pb] strengthened his hand and were an indispensable preparation for the war which Charles believed would eventually reopen.
The immediate reason for war was, once again, the French king's confiscation of Aquitaine.
The duchy had been elevated to the status of a principality and placed in the Black Prince's hands in 1362.
He established a glittering court at Bordeaux, but his administration was not popular with his Gascon subjects.
Pedro of Castile had promised to pay the wages of the troops the Black Prince took to Spain, but he reneged on his obligation, and the prince had to tax his Gascon subjects heavily to raise the money he needed.

The increasing sophistication of urban demands for consumer goods [ptr][pb] such as pots and ironwork for house-building, the problems brought about by the steady withdrawal from continental sources of supply and the need for stronger defences, combined with the entrepreneurial spirit of many local landlords and the increased flow of capital from farming and trading profits to encourage a very rapid development indeed.
An idea of the complexity of this process can be gauged from the events which led to the first successful casting of iron cannon in Sussex, at Buxted in 1543.
The works were owned by the local rector, William Levett, tenanted by Ralphe Hogge and worked by an exiled French specialist, Peter Baude.
For the first time the new cannon offered relative ease of production, and a greater degree of safety in use, unlike the former practice of building up the guns from iron bands held together with loops.
It needed not only a revolution in organisation but in technology too.
Until the sixteenth century most iron had been produced in &bquo;bloomeries&equo;, rough <head>hearths</head>where the iron ore was melted in what amounted to puddles; it could only produce the metal in lumps in small quantities.

Daughter of King Jerome, former ruler of Westphalia during the First Empire, Mathilde had eventually married Count Anatole Demidov, a Russian multi-millionaire whose morals and behaviour were such (he frequently beat her) that she had been separated from him.

The less agreeable side of [pb] Mathilde's nature revealed itself in her tendency to what the French call [hi]l'esprit d&eacute;molisseur [/hi], a sort of wilful destructiveness, which led her to become a focus for the intellectually disaffected during the Empire.

Avoiding artificial lighting and air conditioning was seen to be important in reducing the use of electricity, not only to keep down running costs but also for wider, environmental reasons.
Associated with the different applications of heavy and lightweight structures for energy conservation was the entrants' grasp of a need for zoning and the convenience of localised control.

What sustainable development really represents, one suspects, is a dilemma.
Essentially it comes down to the age-old question which has tormented the rich as much as the fate of their souls: how do you have your cake and eat it?

Industrial society has managed to bake bigger and richer cakes for most of the past two centuries, suffering the occasional bouts of indigestion, but getting fatter most of the time.

There is direct evidence for iron&rehy;smelting from Shakenoak (Oxfordshire), Wakerley (Northamptonshire) and Mucking.
Shakenoak produced iron-working debris (Cleere 1972), whilst at Wakerley and Mucking there were shaft furnaces.
That at Wakerley consisted of a day-lined furnace set 2&frac12; feet into the limestone bedrock.
There was no means of tapping the slag, requiring the furnace to be broken after melting and then rebuilt ( [hi]Med.  [/hi]
[hi]Arch. [/hi] 1971, p. 132).
At Mucking (Jones 1980) blocks of slag were recovered, the largest weighing 24 kilograms, produced when either waste slag or cinder was dropped into the bottom of the shaft, cooling into such blocks.
That slag was at some times tapped during the period is shown by the debris at Shakenoak, which was accompanied by the day linings from four furnaces and forging <head>hearths</head> .

Women, I think, have to be canny in creating these opportunities for themselves, since they do not, on the whole, lead such compartmentalized lives as men, with separate times for &bquo;work&equo; and &bquo;play&equo;.
Hence there is a need to seek out opportunities for creativity in the general fabric of daily life.
&bquo;Creative&equo; is an over-used word nowadays, not easy to define: The &bquo;taste&equo; of creative effort is sometimes a sense of at-oneness with the project, as though you and your task are sharing the same living energy.
Creativity is not restricted to painting magnificent pictures.
It can be found in baking a cake, pruning a tree, or holding a children's party.
Every individual has to find her way of tapping and using her creative resources, whether her daily environment is a home or an office. [/p] [p]

To make a hearth, a space has to be defined and, to some extent, separated from its surroundings, with stone, fire guards and so on &mdash; just as a house has walls and boundary fences.
The hearth has to be made of materials which will withstand heat and provide the right structure for the particular fuel to burn in.
Here there is a similarity with the way in which a home is set up to cope with the needs and activities of its occupants, who may be compared with the living fire on the hearth!
(The active heat of small children, for instance, is best contained in a house of robust furnishings rather than delicate antiques!)
Lastly, the <head>hearth</head>has to be tended, constantly supplied with fuel, and this can be likened to the need for the home to be paid ongoing care and attention, the absence of which will be felt as a cold and empty atmosphere. [/p] [p]

The hearth can be seen as the physical structure of the home, and the fire as the spirit that illuminates it. [/p] [p]
This principle is not confined to any one set of living conditions, for where meaning, order and joy are generated, then any environment can be turned into a welcoming home.
Although the chief focus of this chapter is the &bquo;house&equo; and &bquo;home&equo;, it should also be kept in mind that this can be extended to apply to any circumstances or environment to which a woman gives structure and form.
So, for instance, the interpretations can have relevance to a place of work.
In essence, the Lady of the Hearth represents the way in which we choose and set out a bounded space in which to live, the fire we light at its centre, and the way we use the heat which the fire provides.
We will look at each of these in turn. [/p] [div2] [head]

The hens that roosted on the rafters would scavenge as usual along the shore, and hunt for dropped oats in the straw and bracken Luch had been gathering from the moor all summer.
The cow would be brought in to live in the far end of the hut when the weather finally broke; they'd all keep each other warm.
Their hay would be fed as it had been cut, handful by handful, and should be enough with seaweed and oat straw to feed her till she was helped out in the spring. [/p] [p]

We've deliberately stayed away from the official national trails in England, Scotland and Wales.
The national trails, including paths like the Pennine Way, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path and the West Highland Way, tend to be the best known routes and deserve a rest after the summer of pounding they had.
Anyway, they represent only a fraction of the long distance paths Britain has to offer. [/p] [p]

Good mental health is maintained by having an active social life, interests, variety, by freeing your home life from anxiety as much as possible, and by managing your money.
The pinnacle of your well-being and efforts should be your holiday.
Everyone needs a break, a change from day-to-day routine, a change from life's pressures &mdash; an escape.
Being alone on holidays, though, can be a problem, even a little restricting.
For example, it would not be advisable for a single woman to go on holiday alone to some of the Middle Eastern countries.
Neither would it be a good idea for anyone, male or female, to hitch-hike alone across Europe.
It is, however, possible to respect the limitations without totally abandoning the idea of a <head>holiday</head> altogether, or deciding that you can only go with a friend (which could be disastrous). [/p] [p]

&bull; At our first counselling session I asked Valerie to describe Keith's character; he was loving, caring and independent.
He respected her and made her feel beautiful.
Then I asked her to describe her ex-husband's character.
She told me he was aggressive and overbearing.
He regularly came home drunk and expected his wife to do everything he told her.
He was, in fact, totally different from Keith.
Living with Keith might therefore have a very different outcome. [/p] [p]
True, she agreed, but what about the independence she valued so highly?
I explained to Valerie and Keith that a relationship could be anything they cared to make it.
I asked the couple, during the following week, to write down separately what each would expect of marriage. [/p] [p]

The national dailies peaked later, in 1957, but fluctuated within a comparatively narrow range.
Apart from fairly intangible external factors like changes in the cost of living or unemployment, the fluctuations were caused by the immediate effects of newspaper closures (the [hi]News Chronicle [/hi] and [hi]The Star [/hi] in 1960, for example), by price increases, and by changes such as &bquo;tabloidization&equo;, colour printing and the launch of weekend magazines, and by promotional gimmicks like bingo.

Angus Crichton-Miller, managing director of the Rank Organisation's holidays and hotels division and a member of the study group said: &bquo;It is not an efficient system to have such changes between busy and quiet periods and it would be better if we could flatten prices over a longer season, rather than have such high-peak-season prices.&equo; [/p] [p]

There were only two cases mentioned in the media where a charge of indecent assault involved an older female technically assaulting a girl under 16.
One was reported in a national newspaper and one in a local newspaper.
Both involved lesbian relationships and are fairly cautious.
In one case, it was said that &bquo;it was the 15-year-old girl who was the dominant partner in the relationship&equo; with a 28-year-old woman [pb] separated from her husband, while in the other case &bquo;a pretty 15-year-old schoolgirl skipped lessons to have a lesbian love affair&equo;; however the defence counsel said that her mother had told police she thought there was nothing wrong with a lesbian relationship and &bquo;if it had not been for the age of the young <head>lady</head> , none of us would be here today&equo;.

I had noticed the name on the map; it seemed very remote but I had seen a reference to an inn there.
When I arrived, the village was deathly quiet; a few fishing boats were pulled up on the shingly beach but there was no activity.
I walked the length of the main street twice, looking for the inn or a place of refreshment.
There was nothing.
Shieldaig did not expect visitors and there was no welcome for strangers.
I felt an intruder.
When a native finally appeared, my enquiry about the inn was received with surprise.
There had been an inn years ago but lack of support had closed its doors.
I was directed to the house that had formerly been the inn and was admitted for an overnight stay with supper, bed and breakfast.
The <head>lady</head> of the house lived alone, there were no callers; she was friendly but not communicative and the evening passed in silence. [/p] [p]

He and Southey found Henry Poole living at his father's house, Shurton Court, then recently transformed from a large farmhouse to a townish Georgian mansion.
Henry, who later became the amiable vicar of Cannington, was never a likely recruit to idealistic schemes for emigration.
Nor was his father, William Poole, a landowner and practical farmer renowned for his &bquo;astonishing sagacity in [pb] predicting the course of the weather&equo;.
But the family at Shurton evidently warmed to Coleridge in spite of his views, and it was to Henry's sister Lavinia that he would later address his affectionate short poem &bquo;To a Young <head>Lady</head> on her Recovery from a Fever&equo;.

For Alton, Mike Lake found some improved form after a long time out with injury, to come 899th in 50 mins, 05 secs.
Keith Vallis was 1,134th in 51&ndash;25, Graham Trott 1,262nd (52&ndash;22).
Roger Sayer 1,793th (55&ndash;44), John Harvey, 1,842nd (56&ndash;43) and Doug McLean 2,061st (60&ndash;02).

The new roads gave a fresh life to the old towns on their routes, with a considerable demand for labour, horses and fodder.
Coaches on the way to Hastings made their last stop for horses at Battle's George Hotel, where the ostler lived in a tiny cottage which still stands in the yard, to be roused by the bell outside his front door.
At the height of the turnpikes' use in the 1830s, 36 coaches plied the Brighton run, needing 1200 horses [hi]en route [/hi], and a comprehensive system had emerged from essentially local perceptions of changing need. [/p] [p]

Although the immediate context for the &bquo;attack&equo; on local government was pressure for overall reductions in public spending and local government spending in particular, few of those writing about it have accepted this as a major explanation, partly because the evidence that levels of local government spending are of major significance to the economy are limited, and the arguments that state spending in itself discourages private investment are also weak.
Newton and Karran argue that &bquo;the case for the present degree of control is built on shabby theory and lacks empirical support.

Mrs Thatcher's election to Party Leader in 1975 was to be immensely significant in the context of post-war politics: the tradition of consensual, one-nation government (which had dominated Conservative governments since 1951) was, if not to disappear, to become far less dominant.
Market-orientated, almost [hi]laissez-faire [/hi] attitudes figured ever more prominently in the Conservative Party when in opposition in the 1970s.
Once in government in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hall's deregulatory message was taken up with alacrity. [pb] [/p] [p]
This attitude was most apparent in a speech given in the Isle of Dogs in 1978 by Sir Geoffrey Howe, later to be Mrs Thatcher's first Chancellor (Howe, 1978).
He argued that enterprise zones should be established in which detailed planning controls would cease to exist, certain legal obligations on employers such as employment protection legislation would no longer apply, various taxes would not be levied and the overall management of zones would be undertaken not by <head>local</head>authorities but by some other agency.

Some environmental improvements and land reclamation had additionally taken place. [/p] [p]
It is apparent, however, that the IIA approach has produced a number of problems and complexities.
There is little to indicate that environmental and/or property improvements actually create jobs, boost output or encourage investment.
Support does not necessarily result in employment creation.
Difficulties related to access, parking and outmoded infrastructures often remain.
Improvements to rented property may raise rents to the detriment of the producers as opposed to the landowners.
Too much emphasis may have been placed on grants at the expense of loans for environmental improvements (Meyer, 1986).
Loans allow <head>local</head>authorities to make a profit and will impose commercial considerations on companies having to repay assistance.

Rather, the city became preoccupied by its budgetary dispute with Mrs Thatcher's government and virtually ignored the MDC.
Relations took on a more positive tone in 1989 when the leader of the City Council returned to the Board, reflecting the reconstituted Labour group's more pragmatic policy of forming alliances with government and the private sector. [/p] [p]
Throughout the period, officials of MDC and the local authority have maintained good working relations, which is hardly surprising since many of MDC's plans and personnel were drawn from local authorities.
There have been few disagreements over major planning issues and there has been surprisingly little explicit community opposition to MDC &mdash; except from the Black community in Toxteth.

An elected body may spring from long democratic tradition or little, from a multicultural society or a homogeneous one.

It may be part of a two-house set-up (America gets territorial fairness in its Senate, demographic from the House).

When historians contemplate the widespread monastic reforms of the tenth century, they often see these reforms as an ideal instrument by which kings and bishops could counteract the power of the lay aristocracies in the regions.
This is because the need to reform was felt to arise from the normal attitude of aristocrats in the Germanic world that churches which they had helped to establish were a part of their material property.
Such an attitude, though unfavourable to the concept of a universal church, could be of great benefit to cathedrals, monasteries, and parish churches, because it provided them with protectors, and because often a high standard of religious observance could be stimulated by family pride.
But it also had potential drawbacks, because the use of a church's income, or part of it, to provide for members of a family could assume a disproportionate weight compared with religious observance.
Thus reform could involve a clash with the vested interests of <head>local</head>aristocracies.

The attempt to &bquo;discipline&equo; certain offending local authorities involved the government in many political and legal battles, the passage of several Acts of Parliament, and, ultimately, the creation of a radically reshaped system of local government.
In the 1980 Local Government Planning and Land Act the government took powers to decide the spending totals of each local authority.
When this failed to contain local spending sufficiently, volume targets were introduced together with penalties in the form of loss of central government grant if local authorities exceeded their targets.
In response defiant authorities, invariably Labour controlled, raised the extra money from household and business rates.
Having tried and failed to control spending the government then decided to control <head>local</head>revenue.

Most councillors expect to be lobbied by constituents and asked to intervene on their behalf.
It has always been clear that a councillor must be allowed to see any information he needs to carry out his duties, but it has been unclear how far that goes.
A councillor member of a housing committee wanted to see information in a social services file on prospective adopting parents as she doubted their suitability as adopters.
The House of Lords eventually upheld her right, recognising that she had a genuine interest, but providers of information (particularly the BMA) [pb] and social services staff were extremely uneasy about the apparent danger to confidentiality of client files.

For long British Conservatives praised local government and voluntary groups as a check on an over-mighty (obviously Socialist) central government; such pluralism could also promote experimentation and diversity in policies.
The party, for example, has always opposed mandatory comprehensive secondary education, insisting that the choice be left to each local authority.
Labour, which wanted mandatory comprehensive schooling, was painted as the party of central control and uniformity. [/p] [p]
Conservative defence of local government prevailed until the mid-1970s.
Thereafter, the growing concern over inflation, steep rises in household rates, growth of public spending, and the activities of left-wing Labour authorities led the Conservatives to search for economy.
This culminated in the imposition of far-reaching controls.
The containment of public spending has won out over <head>local</head>choice; reducing the state in this area has meant central government rolling back the local state. [/p] [p]

The impact of such variations in party competition should never be overlooked when analysing the outcome of local elections. [/p] [/div3] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Discussion [/head] [p]
The data we have examined suggest that the poll tax was not itself the prime cause of the variation in results either between types of local authority or individual councils.
Labour's inability to make progress in London as a whole compared with 1986 disguised sharp differences between the boroughs.
However, apart from the exceptional cases of Wandsworth and Westminster, there is no [hi]prima facie [/hi] evidence that borough determined reactions to the poll tax can explain the performance of the parties.
Outside London there was a strong swing to Labour regardless of either political control or the level of the community charge. [/p] [p]

These laminated woods were simply ordinary timber cut up and glued together again.
There existed, however, a distressing class of material known as &bquo;improved woods&equo; which had very much the properties and fate that one would expect from so hubristic a name.
In these materials the wood was impregnated to a greater or less extent with a resin and then compressed to a considerably higher density.
The intention was that the mechanical properties would be thereby improved; they were, but generally only in proportion to the increase in density, at the same time much of the toughness of wood was lost.
Worst of all, they liked to swell back to their original dimensions in water and this swelling was generally unpredictable and irreversible.

The nature and quantity of protein adsorbed depends upon the fluid in question, and varies according to the type of surface.
It also determines the course of subsequent events occurring at the surface, such as platelet adhesion-activation for blood contacting devices, or bacterial adhesion, encrustation and blockage for urinary catheters.
While certain proteins cause these effects to a less extent than others, it is generally considered that uncontrolled adsorption of protein on surfaces in large amounts is undesirable if the surface is to be biocompatible.
As a first stage [hi]in vitro [/hi] screen for biocompatibility of materials, a protein adsorption test is therefore important.
For <head>materials</head> which come into contact with blood, a specific test for fibrinogen adsorption is particularly important because this protein binds in large quantities to synthetic surfaces and is a major platelet-binding protein.

Asphalt was often used as a flat-roof surface in older buildings in locations where it was appreciated that a sheet-metal covering would prove unsuitable because of the very large area of roof or where regular foot traffic was anticipated.
It was also used as the finish for small or irregularly shaped subsidiary roofs over bays and porches, etc.
Where it was used to coat a sloping surface, it is likely that defects will emerge, inviting water penetration, because the material tends to &bquo;creep&equo; under its self-weight.

Last month's record-breaking talks between OPEC members (it was their longest meeting) did not increase the amount of recoverable oil in the world, all it did was lower costs about &dollar;30 a barrel.
Oil will go up in price again.
In turn, the increase will add to the value of current research into alternatives, such as coal. [/p] [p]
Last century, most materials for the chemicals industry were derived from coal tar, made by heating coal to high temperatures in the absence of air and distilling out the volatile products.
This is a complex, variable mixture and the efficiency of conversion is very low.
Coal-tar technology could not cope with the huge expansion in the chemical industry that took place after the Second World War.

For example, reading time and related on-line measures can be used to determine the relative speed of reference resolution (cf Garrod &amp; Sanford 1982 for an application to plural anaphora).
Alternatively, subjects can be invited to write continuation sentences after a sentence of interest, and the incidence of plural or singular anaphoric pronouns in the continuations can be used as an index of preference.
These two methods are not equivalent, since the time-scales over which reading time integration and generation of a continuation take place are different.
In the experiment below, we use the continuation method in order to see which variables lead to preferences for singular or plural reference. [/p] [/div4] [/div3] [/div2] [div2] [head]

There are many reasons why the surgical reconstruction of man is so difficult, but the majority of these are encompassed within two broad conceptual problems.

Fortunately this does not seem to matter too much in some applications &mdash; [hi]eg [/hi] amalgams are used to replace dentine, polymethylmethacrylate replaces the lens of the eye and titanium replaces the bone of the femur.

One area to which this drew Reaumur was iron and steel manufacture.
He conducted a lengthy series of experiments on the conversion of iron into steel, from which he concluded &mdash; contrary to conventional wisdom &mdash; that steel owed its properties not to its exceptional purity, but to the presence of impurities. [/p] [p]
Reaumur was concerned also with trying to make cast iron less brittle.
At the time, iron castings were often unreliable if subjected to stress, as in a gun barrel for example.
Reaumur knew that steel is more brittle than pure iron and connected this with the impurities in it.
He postulated that the brittleness of cast iron resulted from its even greater degree of impurity. [/p] [p]

This short review of the changing styles of sociological research has inevitably left out a great deal, much of which will be discussed elsewhere in this book.
For example, the well&rehy;established tradition of &bquo;community studies&equo;, which involves a researcher or a team of researchers using a wide variety of methods to study a whole community, has been producing work in both Britain and the USA almost continuously since the 1920s.
It has been relatively unaffected, in terms of output, by the changing fashions and styles outlined above.
Furthermore, nothing has yet been said about all the research that does not depend on the collection of data by the sociologist (primary data) but instead makes use of secondary data &mdash; the wealth of <head>material</head> already available from other sources, such as government statistics, personal diaries, newspapers, and other kinds of information.

At this stage we need not worry too much whether the material is glassy or crystalline and all we really need to know about the solid is the Young's modulus and the surface energy.

If [hi]G [/hi] is the surface energy of the solid per square metre, then the total surface energy of the two new fracture surfaces would be 2 [hi]G [/hi] per sq.

The [gap] [pb] large numbers who are unable to find regular work are not seen as a phenomenon characteristic of underdevelopment, but part of the capitalist division of labour and, therefore, a similar feature to the industrialisation process of European countries, differing in terms of quantity rather than quality.
For Marx, however, the function of the reserve army of labour was keeping wages low and, to this end, the absolute size of the reserve army need not be very great.
The high numbers and continuing growth of this sector in Latin America would suggest that concepts of European analysis are not sufficient. [/p] [p]

The Burnham Committee, which had since the First World War been responsible for determining the salaries of teachers, now produced a unified scheme, making no formal distinction between the remuneration of teachers in Primary, secondary modern, or grammar schools.
Serious attempts were made to level up the resources for secondary modem schools, in order to make them comparable with grammar schools, and so achieve that parity to which Ellen Wilkinson was openly committed.
In the county of Kent, for example, in 1938 the expenditure per pupil in central schools (in effect, senior elementary schools attempting to provide a serious alternative to the grammar schools) was only one-half of that for each grammar-school pupil.
By 1948, in the same county, the proportion for secondary moderns had risen to three-quarters. [/p] [p]

Churchill, too, wanted a smaller Cabinet, one dominated by &bquo;overlords&equo; who would co-ordinate the work of clusters of departments.
He sought out members of his old winning team for the purpose.
His original idea was to appoint four peers, which is how they acquired the nickname &bquo;overlords&equo;.

Perhaps, it was surmised, another star had a near-miss with the sun, and supplied additional energy not accounted for in the angular momentum theory. [/p] [p]
One famous theory was derived from the ideas of the popular astronomers Sir James Jeans in England, and T.C. Chamberlain in the United States.
The approaching star pulled out by gravity great elongated filaments of hot material into a curved configuration, which then condensed into the planets.
This had the effect of slowing the rate of rotation as the Sun was induced to emulate the filament around it.
Perhaps, however, it was the Sun's twin star that suffered the collision with another star, leaving a large tendril of ripped-off gaseous material in the vicinity of the Sun which again would have a retarding effect on the Sun.

check batch numbers on rolls to make sure each roll comes from the same batch, and that colours will match. [/p] [p]

A randomization of ``ups'' and ``downs'' is more likely than ordered ``ups''

Because the sensory processes ('hairs') are in [hi]direct [/hi] contact with the source of smell, and because the olfactory cells connect [hi]directly [/hi] with the brain, the sense of smell has a powerful and immediate effect. [/p] [p]
This is because the area of the brain associated with smell is very closely connected with the limbic area of the brain which is [pb] concerned with our most subtle responses such as emotion, memory, sex-drive and intuition.
The olfactory area of the brain also connects with the hypothalamus, a very important structure which controls the entire hormonal system by influencing the &bquo;master gland&equo; itself &mdash; the pituitary. [/p] [p]

[pb] One might equally well undertake trials to see if we are really alive!
But the real laboratory for all such experimentation is within our own body, in the inner areas of mind and soul.
And the technique is called meditation. [/p] [p]
Telepathy is not a sensory phenomenon.
So to attempt to prove the existence of telepathy by the analysis of data acquired by sensory perception will always leave room for doubt.
After all, there is no sensory evidence for the existence of thought, either.
But do we doubt the existence of thought?
Thought is a [hi]mental[/hi] experience, not a [hi]sensory[/hi] experience.

By producing precisely controlled changes in the concentrations of nutrients or salts in the blood it has been possible to explore the role of factors like blood glucose level or cellular dehydration in eating and drinking (LeMagnen 1985; Rolls and Rolls 1982).
Within the last decade, analogous methods have been used to study the role of the gastro-intestinal tract in satiation.
By loading specific parts of the system with food or water it has been possible to investigate, for example, the role of the stomach in the termination of eating and drinking.
What emerges from this work is the complexity of the interactions between components of the system.
For example, loading the stomach with food or water directly has some satiating effect, but not as great as when the substance is also allowed to pass into the intestine or has previously passed through the <head>mouth</head> .

The brander also walks calmly up to the horse and says &bquo;hullo&equo; and gives it a quiet stroke too.
Then, when the brand is hot and the brander comes up to the horse and touches it momentarily on the shoulder (previously clipped), the horse will be surprised, but will probably not even move a step, providing the handler remains relaxed and reassuring. [/p] [p]

First then the proposition that management should accept a responsibility for doing everything possible to keep prices stable or to reduce them.
Management has no business to accept any such responsibility; or rather, since &bquo;management&equo; is merely a collective abstract expression, managements have no business to accept any such responsibility.
The duty of every management is to conduct the business, including the price policy of the business, in the way which in the opinion of the management is likely to maximise the return on the capital invested in the business.

Disposal of industrial waste into rivers and seas is a major source of water pollution, and a recent article in Newsweek (Hewitt et al, 1988) maintains that we have managed to clog the seas of the world with 20 billion tons of garbage.
Coastal waters have suffered most, yet they play the most important role in the chain of life as that is where the majority of marine species spend at least part of their lives, for example in the North Sea many fish have been found to suffer from skin infections, deformed skeletons and tumours.
Not only that, sea birds are often the victims of oil spills.
Human bathers, too, risk viral hepatitis, skin reactions and oral thrush.
However, the article goes on, during the last decade, a United <head>Nations</head> Organization programme has been coordinating the work of environmentalists to halt the scale of pollution, although political will by individual governments is also essential if the fragile ecosystem is to be preserved.

Presumably, therefore, internal [pb] migration exerted no more impact, and probably less, on the British population structure than it had in the nineteenth century.
Notwithstanding the reservations of Glynn and Oxborrow it is clear that population growth rates were less than one third of their nineteenth century peaks and the fact is that there was a substantial loss of population from the old industrial areas to the new ones.
At least a million people of working age migrated to the [sic] the [/sic] South East during the inter-war period, and Wales, as a whole, lost both its <head>natural</head>increase in population and an actual loss of about 450,000 people.

Nor was the lesson lost on him.
The hectic marriage alliances which he, in common with most twelfth-century potentates, engaged in showed a recognition that marriage was a more reliable weapon than warfare in realizing large ambitions. [/p] [p]
It is <head>natural</head>to consider the dynastic marriage policies of this period in the same context as warfare, since both were engaged in by the kings and great nobles for very much the same reasons (see pp. 456&ndash;7).

Schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease, affects some 400 million people in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The cause is a blood fluke, the [hi]Schistosoma mansoni [/hi], which depends on an aquatic snail as an intermediate host.
The parasite multiplies inside the snail, eventually emerging as fork-tailed larvae.
These invade the human body through the skin.
Scientists have attacked the problem from every angle, by education, improving hygiene and eradicating the snail.
Now Otto Gottlieb, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Sao Paulo, and Walter Mors, a Brazilian specialist in the chemistry of <head>natural</head>products, have drawn attention to a possible new approach: chemicals to stop larvae penetrating the skin.

However, it is not suggested, [hi]pace [/hi] Fuller, that the internal morality of law is inherent in the most efficient methods of subjecting human conduct to the governance of rules, although there is more strength than has been generally granted in the view that government can only be compatible with the dignity of man if Fuller's eight requirements for making law are satisfied (Nicholson, 1973&ndash;4).
In fact it is best not to think of ethical positivism as a theory of <head>natural</head>law because this may lead to consequences which are directly contrary to those sought, namely, the appeal to &bquo;higher&equo; laws as a basis for disobeying positive law, and the pursuit of an external validation for the devices of positive law which posits the existence of metaphysical rules to be discovered by a process of moral inspection.

The price you pay for being able to chew when you are young is that you will run out of teeth when you are [pb] old.
This is rather a trivial example: if teeth were the only problem, senescence could be cured by false teeth.
A more fundamental example concerns our brains, which are made of nerve cells which do not divide when we are adult.
When a cell dies, it is not replaced.
This places an upper limit on our lifespan.
But a brain with a fixed number of cells almost certainly works better than one whose cells are constantly dividing.
Now if there are changes, such as non-replacing teeth and non-dividing nerve cells, which make young animals more efficient, at the cost of condemning old animals to senescence, these changes will be favoured by <head>natural</head>selection, if only because most animals die of accidents anyway before they are old.

Thirdly, it seems that both groups of critics would want to see greater support given to natural families, in general, to help them to care for their children more effectively and to prevent the need for substitute care arising.
Again, the difference is one of emphasis.
The &bquo;kinship defenders&equo; are more concerned to press for policy changes, such as more day-care provision to help one-parent families, as urgently necessary; the other group perhaps sees such changes as more long term, as not immediately related to the needs of the children who are currently the subject of placement decisions.

Moreover, just as Moore thought that freedom from the naturalistic fallacy made one more ready to recognize that there is a plurality of basically different sorts of good thing, so Ross thought that freedom from this wrong definition of right and duty in terms of good made one ready to recognize that there is a plurality of grounds of obligation, of which the obligation to produce good and reduce bad is just one, [pb] or rather two, for he thinks the duty to prevent bad a distinct, and usually more stringent, duty than to produce good.

So his &bquo;effects&equo; or &bquo;appearances&equo; are tantamount to Bacon's &bquo;natures&equo;.
But when he speaks of &bquo;causes&equo; he means, he says, either &bquo;efficient causes&equo; (which produce, or bring effects and appearances about) or, in the case of what he calls &bquo;entire causes&equo; (the [hi]combination [/hi] of causes [hi]and [/hi] their effects), a combination of efficient and material causes.
Officially he does not share Bacon's acceptance of formal causes, and even his agreement with him about the relevance to human actions of the final causes of Aristotelian tradition is qualified by the thought that, in the end, they are reducible to efficient causes.
The stress on efficient or productive causes means that, though Bacon's <head>natural</head>philosophy includes Divinity, Hobbes's excludes the theological study of a God that is eternal and ingenerate.

What we might think of as a process of deliberation and choice about our desires is, for him, simply the interplay and jostling of desires amongst themselves; and what we call &bquo;will&equo; is simply the desire that wins.
But though desire determines actions in this way, there nevertheless is, argues Hobbes, a sense in which we can be free.
Indeed, unless our desires do determine our actions, we are not free.
There is no loss of liberty in being carried along on our strongest desire, even when, because of the external circumstances of physical threat, that desire is to turn away from satisfying some other desire.
We are unfree, not when our strongest desire is displaced by an even stronger one, but when it is thwarted by external circumstances and becomes impossible of realization. [/p] [p]

What is meant by saying that such a classification is &bquo;natural&equo;?
After all, any collection of objects could be classified in this way.
Thus suppose that various characteristics (size, shape, colour, etc.) were allotted to objects at random.
The collection could then be classified hierarchically by choosing one character &mdash; say size &mdash; at random, and dividing the collection into orders according to that character.
A second character &mdash; say colour &mdash; could be chosen randomly to subdivide each order into families, and so on, until a complete hierarchical classification was achieved.

There are certain properties we inherit but it is the conditions we live under which dictate how we will develop them and to what purpose we will put them. [/p] [p]
Brian Wells notes: &bquo;Of course, all behaviour is ultimately controlled by the influence which our genes exert upon the development and function of our biological system&equo; (1980, p.29).
I am more concerned with the ways in which social mechanisms work to permit the growth and refinement of abilities necessary for sporting involvement.
By examining social processes, I am not throwing out the baby with the bath water: I do concede that inherited properties play a part.
But ability conceived in a singular way is not sufficient; one cannot assume a situation of perfect competition in which those possessing the necessary physical attributes will emerge as the best sportsmen: the notion of <head>natural</head>ability is not sufficient.

The Germans used a machine which converted oxygen in air into the ozone which they used for their experiments.
However, Drs Keith Brown and Mike Roberts found that nitric acid was produced from atmospheric nitrogen at the same time and that this was responsible for most of the damage.
When they repeated their experiment with ozone produced from pure oxygen they found very little effect. [/p] [p]
Mike Roberts and colleagues at the CEGB's research laboratories now think that air pollution plays only a minor role after all (Forestry, vol 62, pp 179-222).
They agree that yellowing needles are caused by magnesium deficiency.
However, they are not convinced that the primary cause of this is toxic concentrations of aluminium released into the soil as acidity increased. [/p] [p]
Instead they see low concentrations of magnesium as a <head>natural</head>phenomenon exacerbated by air pollution.

Later it can be planted in the aquarium. [/p] [p]
This is a very delicate plant needing special attention.
It must have very clear, fresh water and therefore the water should be changed very frequently, and great care should be taken not to allow algae growth.

Sometimes side-shoots grow from the rhizome.

The method of enquiry employed in much of the work within the comparative field proceeds at the empirical level and arrives at more general conclusions through a process of inductive reasoning, or more [hi]ad hoc [/hi] interpretive insights.
Relatively few studies begin with an explicit ( [hi]ex-ante [/hi]) theory which is then rigorously tested against the data.
In large part this is a reflection of the underdeveloped state of industrial relations theory itself to whose improvement, by way of helping more general theory construction, well-designed comparative studies may be expected to contribute.
It is thus a field of considerable potential.

Falconry is not a sport confined to women, but on this occasion I felt I had seen the perfect emblem for the &bquo;Mistress of the Beasts&equo;.

The first thing the researchers discovered was that special infrared cameras, designed to pick up the heat given off by warm-blooded animals, failed to detect polar bears &mdash; the insulation provided by their coats is too efficient.
Much more interesting, however, were the results of further research into the hairs themselves.
The bear's hairs, like those of the mountain goat, are hollow.
They are also transparent to ultraviolet light which they conduct, in the manner of an optical fibre, from the tip of the hair to the skin, where its energy is converted into heat.
The hairs are transparent only to ultraviolet light: other light in the visible range is reflected, which is why the coat appears white.

Generally, if you have at least two or three slices of good wholemeal bread each day, and some other wholegrain cereal product, this will form a good base around which to design your meals, and add other iron-rich foods.
If you have liver or a generous portion of a soya product at least once a week this will help.
Soya flour is a good iron source that can be added to many foods (sauces, curries, bolognese, meat dishes like stews or cottage pie, bread or home-made cake mix, porridge).
In fact, if you love cake and sweet things but you are concerned about the nutritional status of your diet, it is a good idea to experiment with making your own iron-rich &bquo;health&equo; cake.
Use wholemeal flour instead of white.
Add a little soya flour.

Deacon's structure involves two complementary shapes joined at right angles; shapes that one has never seen before but one recognises as familiar.
The first shape is a stack of diminishing wooden ovals, and one looks into it as through the wrong end of an extended telescope.
The second shape comes out of the first like the extension of an igloo. [/p] [p]

Both parts can be seen as different versions of one another, but there is an absence of inner connection between them.

In contrast, the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when, during October 1961, the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the UK.
These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area. [/p] [p]
As noted above, the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced.
Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates (1964) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler [hi]et al. [/hi] (1983) in distinguishing public (or what we might call societal) hazards from private (individual) ones.

But there is an important difference between the clock, which is what Locke calls an &bquo;artificial substance&equo;, and naturally occurring substances such as gold.
The clock's designer would know the details of its real essence whereas, says Locke, none of us know the real essence of gold.
Our sensory capacities are too limited.
Beyond conceiving it in corpuscular terms, we have no idea of it.

For two thousand years and more the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics had dealt with arguments and proofs about the existence and nature of God, his relation to the world and human beings, and such related matters as human freedom and life beyond death.
These were widely (though never universally) held to be demonstrable by appeal either to direct awareness or intuition, or, more often, by indirect argument starting off from ordinary human experience of ourselves and the world around us.
Theology had long been [corr] familiar [/corr] with this kind of argument, and had on occasion made very extensive use of it.
The outstanding example is to be found in the work of the greatest of the medieval theologians, Thomas Aquinas, who died in 1274.
He offered a series of philosophical proofs of God's existence &mdash; the &bquo;Five Ways&equo; &mdash; which could supply a &bquo;<head>natural</head>theology&equo;, a theology which could be established, at least in principle, by the exercise of natural human powers of reasoning.

For the eastern border of the Saxons was the River Elbe, and that too was an artery of Saxon communication.
But never could the Elbe be securely held until the Slavs across it, the Danes near the lower end of it, and the Bohemians on its upper reaches, were all tamed and Christianized.
The Danes, and the Swedes, were already perceived to pose a missionary problem in the ninth century; their Christianization was one response to what would become known to historians as the Viking threat.
Similarly, the Hungarians became the principal external threat to the Christianized Germanic peoples of Europe in the late ninth and tenth centuries, particularly in conjunction with the Slavs; and after the former's defeat and settlement on the Middle Danube, it was a <head>natural</head>instinct of the Saxon rulers to draw them into the orbit of western Christian kingdoms.

The important characteristic of an evolutionarily stable strategy, you will remember from earlier chapters, is that it carries on doing well when it is already numerous in the population of strategies.
To say that Tit for Tat, say, is an ESS, would be to say that Tit for Tat does well in a climate dominated by Tit for Tat.
This could be seen as a special kind of &bquo;robustness&equo;.
As evolutionists we are tempted to see it as the only kind of robustness that matters.
Why does it matter so much?
Because, in the world of Darwinism, winnings are not paid out as money; they are paid out as offspring.
To a Darwinian, a successful strategy is one that has become numerous in the population of strategies.
For a strategy to remain successful, it must do well specifically when it is numerous, that is in a climate dominated by copies of itself. [/p] [p]

The consequence is a realization that it is precisely the hierarchical and cybernetic attributes of living organisms that enabled evolution to acquire the direction emphasized by Hobhouse at the start of the century. [/p] [p]
Julian Huxley's directional component in evolution is made possible only by an increasing subtlety of internal integration of the body and a corresponding increase in the inter-individual integration in societal processes involved in reproduction.
Both of these depend on the capacity of organisms to integrate previously separated functions through the imposition of a superordinate system relating its subordinate parts; and this requires the open transfer of information between those parts.

A predictable consequence of long-term rising unemployment, unless there is a widespread economic decline, is that first men, and then families, move in search of work, usually leaving elderly people behind.
At the point of departure, when young middle aged children are most likely to seek work, their parents are often fit and future problems do not loom large.
The elderly people may have a range of social connections which would understandably be given up with reluctance and they often do not at that stage need to give up their home.
Yet, since family remains the prime source of close personal care, ten years on the situation may become precarious and fraught with practical and social complications.
Apart from immediate logistical difficulties, the <head>natural</head>links of reciprocity may be weakened over the years by geographical distance so that a natural and gradual change in the balance between dependence and independence has not been effected.

high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.  These
turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, ``Most modern
chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma.'' Interest picks
up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the
Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.  Not long after the
appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the
number of animal designs seen on the earth.  The vast majority of them,
however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that
were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of
<head>natural</head> selection to operate.

If it was, then it must have been God's intention to translate him at a
certain point from time to eternity.  One night, so some of these theories
run, Adam would have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation
of Eve; and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal.
The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an
illustration of the thesis that death can not be only a punishment, for
some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural
order of time and change.  On the other hand, Christian faith knows that
death is more than the <head>natural</head> termination of temporal

Varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine, but
he pulls himself together when the need arises.  Both monks respond to the

If the site is on a reservoir, the level of the water at various seasons as
it affects recreation should be studied.  Check the quality of the water.
A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other
lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by
pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an
industrial area.  Other factors, such as water temperature, depth of water,
the fish life it supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its

Properly developed, it gives reason, conceived as the quest for coherence, comprehensiveness and sensitivity to reality, almost as great a role as it can play anywhere.
What it does, however, suppose absent in ethical deliberation is any actual truth of the matter at which it aims.
Here it distinguishes it from factual enquiry, at least as that is conceived by those with a robust sense that there is a way things really are in the world.
It may see this as meaning that reason has less hope of producing convergence in ethics than on factual matters. [/p] [p]
It should be noted that the attitudinist theory of ethics operates at a rather different level from a theory such as utilitarianism.
Utilitarianism is a properly ethical theory, inasmuch as it puts forward the basics of a moral position, while emotivism belongs to what is sometimes called meta-ethics which professes to explain the <head>nature</head> of what is going on when an ethical or moral view is advocated.

The theory underpinning crisis intervention is of particular relevance to social work practice with old people and their families.
Frequently a crisis is precipitated by some sudden change in health or behaviour, of the elderly person or a carer.

An exception may be illustrated by a passage from a classic biography, that of John Constable by Charles Leslie.
Leslie was himself a painter, and thus comments in his own right on his friend's art, as here on a painting of Hampstead Heath: [quote] [p]
I have before noticed that what are commonly called warm colours are not necessary to produce the impression of warmth in landscape; and this picture affords, to me, the strongest possible proof of the truth of this.
The sky is of the blue of an English summer day, with large, but not threatening, clouds of a silvery whiteness.

By introducing controversial issues in the school, like Northern Ireland, race relations, aid to underdeveloped countries and nuclear weapons, schools were engaging in a politicisation of the curriculum which verged on, often slipped over into, quite unacceptable indoctrination.
This kind of teaching, it was argued, implicitly if not explicitly, was unacceptable because it would lead to an undermining of loyalty to the nation and government in minds too tender truly to comprehend the import of what was happening to them. [/p] [p]
Is citizenship education, in contrast to political education, therefore &bquo;safe&equo;?
Is it being introduced into the schools because of this characteristic?
We may test this suspicion by reference to various statements concerning the perceived <head>nature</head> of the new Citizenship Education (though unfortunately because of frequent postponements of its publication date, the National Curriculum Council guidance document on Citizenship as a cross-curricular theme is not available at the time of writing).

And so they follow the pattern of Foucault's less textually-oriented work.
Although they recognize that social relations, discourses, and language are not the same thing, their practice tends to belie this.
Sometimes they approach language as if it expresses power relations and subjectivity directly, and originates from the very autonomous, fixed subjects whose existence they are challenging.
They ignore ambiguities in their own writing, and in their interview material, which they treat as unproblematically quotable.
Hollway, for example, quotes a man's description of his split relationship with a woman as &bquo;shrivelled&equo; (Henriques [hi]et al [/hi].

Chemical structure also influences the degree of adsorption of the compound on soil particles.
Such adsorption may be a problem when using above-ground reactors.
Typically, stubborn compounds are also quite hydrophobic, and adsorb readily on inert solids.

What kept insects extremely small over millions of years of evolution, and why have only a few mammals ever approached the size of dinosaurs?

We ought first to remind ourselves that for every type of animal throughout time there has always been a most convenient size that has fitted it neatly into its own niche.

Characteristic of Lanzarote are the numerous cones of extinct volcanoes, their surfaces smoothed and rounded by the dry, fierce winds heading out across the Atlantic from the Moroccan Sahara.
Large areas of island are covered with thick deposits of black volcanic ash, known locally as picon.
These undulating planes are punctured here and there by gaping, jagged craters, disintegrating hillsides and rugged lava beds.
Rainfall is minimal and the land is infertile, marked by erosion and extreme dryness.
In a desperate attempt to hold in what moisture there is in the thin soil, farmers have constructed low walls as refuges for vines and other crops.

One of the problems with economic cycles is that they create surpluses and slacks in demand which affect the stability of the work force.
The traditional role of governments in the UK has been to ease the pressures on both companies and individuals by some form of intervention &mdash; subsidies, loans or payments etc.
In recent years the Employment Department and the Department of Trade and Industry have been responsible for appropriate interventions but they have been more of a fire fighting nature than a sustained development of policy and role &mdash; which in any case, has not been the way government departments have tended to behave since they are organised to implement government policy in the immediate rather than long term.

So it has been for centuries, yet the multi-petalled bloom of modern times, epitomized by the modern Hybrid Tea rose (or, as it is abbreviated, H.T.) and probably most people's mental image of all that a rose is and should be, is a product of modern hybridizing and cross-breeding that did not exist even as recently as medieval times.
Long before then, however, the rose had already found a place in the heart of man.
To the human eye and senses, even the simply constructed single bloom of the hedgerow wild rose is so sublimely beautiful in the bud that it is represented in the earliest forms of art and pictorial decoration.
The common use of the rose in heraldry illustrates how deeply and firmly it became associated with and identified as a symbol of family arms and crest, class and dynasty.
In the twentieth century the rose is still regarded as something basically British, regal and exalted; it symbolizes quality and superiority. [/p] [p]

Second, the trade-union movement continued to grow while the Labour Party established itself (if only as an adjunct of Liberalism), and as both institutions were significant expressions of sectional interests, they created apprehension among the political authorities.
Third, there was the severe deterioration of industrial relations in the few years prior to 1914 which brought with it violent strikes and syndicalism.

This would increase the time needed.
The two effects would, very approximately, cancel out. [/p] [p]
Thus there has been more than enough time for selection to generate specific DNA sequences of the required length.
This [pb] conclusion is supported by the fact that changes in the fossil record, even rather rapid ones like the increase in human brain size in the last four million years, were slower by a factor of 1,000 than the rate at which changes can be produced by artificial selection in laboratory populations or domestic animals.

The radiation of the African great apes and man represents a set of adaptations by a common stock, the Dryopithecine apes, to differing ecological conditions.
Kortlandt argues that the formation of the Great Rift Valley system in East Africa combined with the Nile and Zambezi drainage systems to constitute a geographical barrier to the east of which the Dryopithecine apes adapted to a progressive desiccation of the landscape caused by the rise of the Rift mountain ridges in combination with climatic trends.
This form developed bipedalism and other adaptations to the newly opening arid savannah landscape and eventually became the ancestor of man.
By contrast, to the West of the Rift the mosaic <head>nature</head> of the relatively dry forest woodlands north of the Niger&ndash;Benue river system constituted a cradle for the evolution of the adaptable, partly terrestrial, chimpanzee with its variable fruit food supply and capacity for mobility.

The photometric evidence results from an analysis of the near-infrared emission obtained from a Japanese balloon-borne telescope launched nearly a decade ago.
In the infrared, extinction by dust is an order of magnitude smaller than in the visible portion of the spectrum.
By analysing the emission above and below the plane (the whitish regions in Fig. 1), it is possible to make a quantitative assessment of the shape of the bulge.
If the bulge is axisymmetric, lines of sight that make the same angle on either side of the centre will appear equally bright.
On the other hand, if the bulge is elongated and its long axis is at some angle <head>oblique</head> to the line of sight (see Fig. 3), perspective effects cause equivalent lines of sight on either side of the centre to have systematically different surface brightnesses.

Where the transform faults occur on land they are associated with significant topographic features such as the valley of the Irrawaddy River in Burma. [/p] [p]
In order to emphasize the pattern of stress in oblique-slip margins, the terms transpression and transtension have been applied to, respectively, the convergent and divergent varieties.
Although these two types of margin are associated with distinct types of landscape, they may occur in close proximity owing to the tendency of transform faults to contain offset segments or to have a sinuous form rather than being purely straight (Fig. 3.26).
Divergent oblique-slip [gap] [pb] motion leads to extensional (normal) faulting and subsidence and if this is of sufficient magnitude a pull-apart basin may be formed.

Again, these vary considerably from one classroom to another.
The challenge, clearly, is to reduce the proportion of &bquo;routine&equo; and &bquo;disciplinary&equo; interactions and increase the proportion concerned with work.
A high proportion of disciplinary interactions may reflect (as in the case of Deacondale) a lack of &bquo;<head>oblique</head> &equo; disciplinary strategies and a tendency to adopt a more confrontational style; and a high proportion of routine interactions may stem from an excessively complex organization or an inability to engage in depth with the content of the tasks given to one's pupils.

In Bede's opinion, Aldfrith was most learned in the Scriptures ( [hi]HE [/hi] IV, 26).
After he became king, Aldhelm wrote a treatise on metre for him in the form of a letter to Arcircius (Aldfrith) and Adomn&aacute;n, abbot of Iona, gave him a copy of his work on [hi]The Holy Places [/hi] ( [hi]HE [/hi] V, 15).
Abbess Aelfflaed's question to Cuthbert, bishop of Lindisfarne, as to who would succeed the childless Ecgfrith need not imply that she had otherwise forgotten about Aldfrith's existence, but rather that she was testing Cuthbert to ascertain that his loyalties lay in the right place.

CL observations are usually made on uncovered thin sections.
They must be bonded with thermo-stable epoxy resin (see Chapter 4).
Bonding agents such as Lakeside 70 and Canada Balsam are unsuitable mountants for CL work as they are volatile, causing blistering and rapid charring under the electron beam.
Some epoxy resins also show luminescence (usually yellow) which can interfere with observations. [/p] [p]
Polished surfaces give the best optical resolution, and the double polished thin sections described in Chapter 4 are ideal.
If great detail is not required, surfaces can be quite crudely prepared.
Etching of [pb] limestones with dilute acid gives an apparent increase in luminescence intensity, but this is due to points of high relief catching the <head>oblique</head> beam, with shadowing giving an increase in contrast but at the expense of resolution.

We are confronted with a number of paradoxes: Eliot proclaimed the impersonality of great poetry, and yet his own [pb] personality and experience are branded in letters of fire upon his work.
He was a poet who insisted upon the nature and value of a tradition, and yet he had no real predecessors or successors.
He was a writer who attempted to create order and coherence, and yet his central vision was of&quot; the Void&quot;.
His poetic voice is unmistakable, and yet it was composed from a number of other poets' voices which he adapted or borrowed.
He was a strange, private and often bewildered man who was raised into a cultural guru, a representative of authority and stability. [/p] [p]

This gives the impression of a painting in a frame, an impression also given by the drawing of the central panels in the two mosaics from Verulamium.
In no. 15 indeed, we might be dealing with a prefabricated panel (Neal 1976b, 249; Neal 1981, no. 75): this is suggested by the cutting of the lion's tail by the bordering line.
However, it is possible that such&quot; cutting&quot; was intentional, in order to create the effect of a movement away from the spectator (who is seen to be receiving a privileged view).
Such an interpretation would be more in keeping with the proficient organisation of space throughout the rest of the pavement.

Entire crypts are rarely displayed on single sections.
Indirect estimates of total crypt length were therefore made.
The total number of labelled and unlabelled cells was counted under an optical grid over the full thickness of the mucosa at a number of sites chosen at random on each specimen (approximately 1000 cells per site).
The average number of labelled cells (x) per 50 hemicrypts in the proliferation zone was used to extrapolate to the total crypt size.
For example, if x=4, and there were 20 labelled cells in a population of 1000 cells, it could be assumed that the cell population represented 20/4, or five hemicrypts.
Hence the mean hemicrypt length was 1000/5, or 200 cells.
Factors such as <head>oblique</head> and transverse cuts and cell overlap would affect the accuracy of this estimation. [/p] [/div3] [div3] [head]

They were called the chordates, and started a momentous chain of evolutionary events.
They had rudimentary spinal columns and became the forerunners of fish.
Original vertebrate material was probably of the softer cartilage type, rather than hard bone, plus a brain-case housing an elaborate nervous system.
Even today some creatures, such as modern sharks, still have a solid gelatinous backbone, probably exemplifying an embryonic structure midway between the cartilaginous and [pb] bony vertebra of more developed classes.
However, the chordates were not quite fish, since they were without jaws or fins and fed by sucking in water and whatever nutrients it contained. [/p] [p]

But it had become impossible for Mr Major to plod on with the same soiled team.
Honest Tories confess that things had become distinctly worse than normal, even allowing for the grumps of mid-term recession and by-election rebuff.
Unrest in Parliament reached a new intensity this week.
The prospect of public-spending cuts had produced the usual bout of cabinet in-fighting.
Hints from Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, of a no-holds-barred review of welfare spending left Tory MPs wondering about the wisdom of &bquo;thinking aloud&equo; &mdash; provoking, frightening, then denying &mdash; rather than ruminating silently before striking.

Coercion is possible when there is a government willing to use state power, but it also fails &mdash; not solely because coercion as a means to an end tends to fail but because both programmes, in order to achieve any impact, involved very large numbers of people, even the majority, which implies serious problems for the logistics of coercion and of mass political backlash.
States that are exploring a tough policy which borders upon coercion like Kenya will either find that open political protest will challenge the power of the state, or that like family planning in India, an onslaught upon the least economically and politically powerful is only temporarily feasible.
More passive forms of resistance such as stealing wire and fence <head>posts</head> which exclude people from afforestation projects, ring-barking plantations, setting protected pastures alight, collecting firewood by night and so on, are resorted to and are almost beyond the power of enforcement agencies to stop.

The Poles had nurtured the hope that the French would restore the old Polish state with Danzig attached as before, but Napoleon had other ideas.
He strung the Poles along to the very end in order to keep their enthusiasm for his cause and their manpower for his army.
Danzig became a Free City attached to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw &mdash; a Duchy that was grand in name only.
In effect Warsaw became a staging post on the road to Moscow and the Poles were little more than cannon fodder.
Most of the Poles who went to Russia in the belief that this would help to restore their country's independent existence never returned: of the 82,000 Poles who made up the Grand Arm&eacute;e's V Corps, only 2,300 survived the retreat from Moscow.

Modern scientific excavation techniques yield prodigious quantities of data, and the abilities of even quite simple personal computer database programs to organise, tabulate and sort this information offer the archaeologist very obvious benefits.
Such computer software is rapidly becoming the archaeologist's workhorse, both during the excavation process in circumstances where immediate feedback is desirable, and afterwards to help in preparing the final published report.
Invaluable as this sort of computing may be, the archaeologist's spade reveals more interesting and mathematically challenging problems.
Much archaeology involves looking for underlying patterns within a jumble of visual detail.
In extreme cases the search for order among the chaos can become too difficult for the human eye alone. [/p] [p]

Vincent once tried to persuade him to give up his safe career and join him as a fellow painter &mdash; like other famous brothers in art history.
Was he tempted?
If he had been, it would have meant the end of Vincent's support-system.
Are we to deduce from this that Vincent saw Theo as an artist-manqu&eacute;, or was he simply trying, not too hard in this instance, to shift the guilt a child feels before a self-sacrificing parent?
These are speculative questions.
One thing is certain: the burden this younger brother assumed, of caring for Vincent like a parent &mdash; sometimes a mother, sometimes a father &mdash; extended him both financially and emotionally to a dangerous extent.

Centralization and bureaucratization were historically closely linked to the growth of a monetized economy, which provided the fiscal resources for the rise of absolutist states in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe.
In turn, the new monarchs tried to build up an economically prosperous bourgeoisie to increase tax revenues and to prevent any reversion to feudal conflicts which would fragment the nation &mdash; state.
By paving the way for a national free market, absolutism fostered capitalism.
Bureaucratization and centralization were also tied to the growth of liberal democracy and socialism in intended and unintended ways.
The opening of administrative <head>posts</head> to meritocratic recruitment and the strong emphasis upon the rule of law in [pb] constitutional regimes strengthened the legitimacy of central government.

The secret of attracting more people to your gigs is to get your band's name better known.

A call for action ``before it is too late'' has alarming implications when
it comes from a man who, in his previous reports on the schools, cautioned
so strongly against extreme measures.  These warnings must not be treated
lightly.  Dr. Conant's conscientious, selfless efforts deserve the nation's
gratitude.  He has served in positions of greater glamour, both at home and
abroad; but he may well be doing his greatest service with his

During the Brown trial, however, the state's most powerful Democratic
newspaper, the Providence Daily Post, stated that Brown was a murderer, a
man of blood, and that he and his associates, with the assistance of
Republicans and Abolitionists, had plotted not only the liberation of the
slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments.  The
Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid
of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that ``
He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party, who proclaim as
one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in
the states''.  The two major newspapers in Providence continued, throughout
the crisis, to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and
attempting to falsify history.  While the Daily <head>Post</head>

Democrats, the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities

Takeover stock traders and other investors, however, have been pushing for
some form of recapitalization to regain the losses they suffered when the
labor-management bid collapsed.  When Adolph Coors Co. announced the
appointment of William Coors as president late Wednesday, Peter Coors was

The likelihood is that a bust will come, perhaps later this year or early next year.
Alongside the world's fastest economic growth rates (real GNP rose by 12.8% last year, an annual 14% in 1993's first quarter) has come accelerating inflation.
Nobody knows the true measure of that inflation, but in the cities it is something in the region of 15&ndash;20% a year, and rising.
China's shift from a planned economy towards a market system has involved the dismantling of old controls but not their replacement with new ones.

As Laurence Martin has said: &bquo;It is impossible to refute entirely the criticism that the various strategies of limitation may appear to make the world safe for nuclear warfare and thereby hasten its onset&equo;; but he concluded: &bquo;The proper [pb] question may therefore be not, should we contemplate limited nuclear war, but, should we consider the ways of limiting the nuclear war which is henceforth always a possibility&equo; (Howard, 1979, pp. 119 and 120). [/p] [p]
Above all, the extremely strong presumption against the legality of the use of nuclear weapons needs not only to be reaffirmed, but also made more specific.
Nuclear weapons cannot escape from the kinds of <head>restraints</head>built up carefully in the laws-of-war tradition over the centuries, but there is a risk that they may be thought to be so escaping (especially in view of the UK and US reservations to [hi]1977 Geneva Protocol I [/hi]) unless positive action in this direction is taken, The comparative neglect of the whole subject of laws-of-war restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons has endured for forty years, for reasons which can be understood if not approved.

RESTRAINT AND GUIDANCE [/head] [p]
These techniques often have rather arcane titles but in their simple forms, they boil down to physical restraint.
Advocate them only if you are sure that the parents can complete them without loss of temper and possible physical risk to the child. [/p] [p]
The first is simple restraint and an example was given earlier of parents returning Robert to his bed when he climbed into theirs.
He was restrained from completing the undesirable behaviour of getting into their bed.
Other examples are restraining a child from throwing bricks in a nursery, restraining another from overturning furniture and others from biting their wrists, head banging and the like. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]

Again, a 12 month restraint on competition might be enforceable against a partner or a senior executive or even a top manager.
But it would probably be too long for someone further down.
If the restraint is confined to acting on behalf of people who were clients of your firm during the subsistence of the employment, it may be valid.
If it covers people who were clients before or who could become clients afterwards, it will be void. [/p] [p]

But another [pb] European country, Spain, did seek to conquer England, in 1588; and it was encouraged by the dramatic &bquo;Address to the Captains and Men on the Armada&equo;, which promised the sailors the aid of the saints of England, John Fisher, Thomas More and Edmund Campion, and above all &bquo;The blessed and innocent Mary queen of Scotland, who, still fresh from her sacrifice, bears copious and abounding witness to the cruelty and impiety of this Elizabeth and directs her shafts against her.&equo;
And the future pope Urban VIII could write of Mary as the queen who died without honour due; yet the shadows of night were her funeral robes, the stars her tapers.
It was all very stirring. [/p] [p]
What is immediately notable, however, is that Mary's own subjects, the Scots &mdash; that is, those in Scotland left to deal with the crisis created by her deposition in 1567 and flight to England in 1568, rather than Catholic exiles like Blackwood and the bishop of Ross, on whom there were no <head>restraints</head>&mdash; had the good sense to keep as quiet as possible.

It was not merely that many people were dismayed by Labour's tax plans: they also felt a wider and deeper sense of mistrust, that Labour's numbers on revenue and spending simply did not add up.
They liked Mr Major, whose performance visibly improved as his public assurance grew in the later stages of the campaign.
They remained uneasy and mistrustful of Mr Kinnock.
In a reverse image of Mr Major's public appearances, as the Labour leader's belief in victory grew in the last days, so his studied calm and <head>restraint</head>slipped away, and a fatal hint of the &bquo;cocky Welsh boyo&equo; marked his public performances. [/p] [p]

Or the child who will not, for example, remain in bed may need to be held there. [pb] [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]
How long should restraint last? [/head] [p]
As long as it takes the child to cease movement.
This can be a matter of seconds but some children have been known to squirm or resist for as long as 30 minutes.
Under these circumstances the parents need to be able to take over from each other so that it is the child who tires and not the parents. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]
How does the child leant to do without this type of punisher? [/head] [p]
Again the warning is vital as it was for the last two techniques.
It is also vital that a targeted desirable behaviour is taught to the child to compete with the punished behaviour.
This last statement should be true for most punishment situations but it is particularly necessary with the <head>restraint</head>method.

Early work on improving junctions in residential roads in the experimental area used temporary measures such as concrete tubs, but the final design makes use of ramps, tightening of the radius of the entrance, coloured paviours to emphasize the right of way of crossing foot and cycle traffic, tree planting and flowerbeds (Figures 6.6 and 6.7).

Similar stages in reconstruction may be seen in the examination of the remodelling of the junction between the Altl&auml;nderstrasse and the main road bounding the trial area to the north.
Previously, speeding traffic along the main road often used the traffic islands painted on the road for overtaking purposes and was able to turn at speed into Buxtehude at this generously proportioned junction (Figure 6.8).

It is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover, or whether its remains were swept in from some other place.
Fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders.
The type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine, freshwater or terrestrial, providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated.
The sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal (p. 20) to give direct evidence of its past activities.
From the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs, and to measure their stride.

Doubtless many poets envied Duck, for whom the queen had &bquo;Enlarg'd thy Bottle, and enrich'd thy Beer&equo;.
Yet, on one level, these poems mark a recognition that Stephen Duck had changed the relation of the labouring class to the literary market.
Whereas prior to his success literate elements in the labouring class had been mainly consumers of literature, now they could take on somewhat more confidently the role of producers in that broader market.
The growth of the book trade in the eighteenth century was necessary for that change.
Stephen Duck's poetry, for example, appeared in twelve editions before he published an authorized edition.
Booksellers could translate the royal favour into profit for themselves.

Against this, Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary, and that they contain implicit images and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to.
This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the &bquo;fusion of horizons&equo; (the reader's and the text's), Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture, and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature.

Modern historians have for long assumed this rise, and stressed its importance; and yet its nature and the evidence for it have never been properly analysed.
If we wish to map trends in population in the modern world, we can use the statistics provided by a modern census.
We can measure population fairly precisely; we can tell whether its rise was due to the birth of more children or to men and women living longer, that is, to a rise in the birth-rate or a fall in the death-rate.
If the birth-rate is rising, we can discover whether this is due to women bearing more children or having them younger, so that the generations succeed one another more rapidly.

This question is impossible to answer.
If we look at, for example, Graeco-Roman mythology, we discover that the constellations in the night sky can be directly equated with gods, goddesses, heroes and other mythological notables.
Did the ancients watch the heavens and, from what they saw there, construct their whole complicated pantheon?
Or was it that they developed their legends of the deities and then saw' those deities portrayed in the sky?
Why did the ancients identify the planets with such important deities &mdash; Mars, Venus, Jupiter and the rest?
For that matter, why was the Moon &mdash; by far the most obvious object in the night sky &mdash; equated with only a minor deity, Diana?
Would the whole story not have made more <head>sense</head> had Jupiter been identified with the Sun, Venus with the Moon, and so on? [/p] [p]

Taking this perception to the lower species, we can begin to glimpse how both we and they are constructed, from within-out.
Just like ourselves, the real creature's feeling for itself is subjective, within its own mind structure.
What a fellow member of its same species sees of it, is quite different from what the individual feels about itself.
It is certainly very different from that which other species perceive of it, for the sense organs of different species are constructed differently and perceive things in different ways, as we have seen. [/p] [p]

This perspective aims to present teaching as a self-conscious enquiring enterprise whereby classroom activities are referred to theoretical principles of one sort or another.
These principles essentially define the subject: they are the bearings that teachers need to take in order to plot their course.
The theory which provides such bearings may come from a variety of sources: from experience or experiment, from sudden inspirational insight, from the archives of conventional wisdom.
But wherever it comes from, the theory needs to be made explicit and public if its relevance to pedagogy is to be effectively assessed. [/p] [p]

Tolkien obviously hoped in one way to recreate it.
More generally, the link between the last three sections of this book is Tolkien's perception, from [hi]Pearl [/hi] and from poems like it, that poetry does not reduce to plain <head>sense</head> (so far most critics would agree with him), but furthermore that this is because words have over the centuries acquired meanings not easily traced in dictionaries, available however to many native speakers, and (this is where many critics part company) at times breaking through the immediate intentions of even poetic users.

The third doubtfully determined outcome was from a builder who had been in financial difficulties.
Lawyer C had conveyed his house in the teeth of a re-possession order from a loan company, and generally extricated him from the debts of his own dissolved partnership.
Thus the case could properly be classified as one in which the client determined the outcome.
Unfortunately, however, he did not pay lawyer C's firm.
The [pb] firm recovered their money by retaining monthly instalments paid to the client via them from the buyer of the client's house, to whom the client had lent &pound;400 to secure the sale.

For both good and bad reasons the emphasis on man's individuality which has dominated the West since the close of the Middle Ages is now being discouraged in favour of emphasizing community.
Man's individuality is now viewed against wider frames of unity such as the state, the balance of nature, the progress of evolution and the historical process.
The merits of individuality are being lumped together with the dangers and both are being dismissed as &bquo;individualism&equo;.
The advantages of unity over diversity, or collectivism over individualism, are assumed to be self-evident and the obvious totalitarian overtones are ignored. [/p] [p]

The killing a year ago of Kenya's foreign minister, Robert Ouko, is still unsolved.
His burnt and tortured body was found on a brushy hill near his home in western Kenya.
The government refuses to release a Scotland Yard report on the death, and is instead running its own commission of inquiry.
The dead man's brother has gone to ground.
Lavish press coverage keeps the issue before the public.
The government says it had nothing to do with the case.
Kenya's tranquillity could vanish if it were shown to be involved: the killing prompted the first of last year's riots. [/p] [p]

When a woman's voice is used freely and has power, it can sound and feel like a flow of light.
Studying voice production does not mean that a voice is artificially manufactured, but that the body is trained so that the voice may be &bquo;uncovered&equo;.

At its best, singing can feel like a river of light flowing through a firm yet flexible channel.

However, von Baer regarded the multitude of sperm cells swimming around in the semen as single-celled parasites, and he perpetuated this view by calling them &bquo;spermatozoa&equo;, i.e. sperm animals.
During the 1840s, Albert von Koelliker showed that spermatozoa are not parasites, but products of cells in the testis.

With the Winter premiere of their play, MOTHERS, the three women use their own unique style to redefine the concept of mime while investigating the myths of mother love and the image of the &bquo;perfect&equo; mother that is consistently upheld in society.
Claudette Williams went along to take a closer look. [/p] [p]
MOTHERS is a moving portrayal of the relationship between West Indian mothers and their daughters by the Black Mime Theatre's sister trio, the Women's Troop.
It is honest, humorous and compulsive.
I felt totally drawn into the piece as I recognised struggled I've had with my own mother and my feelings of shame, and fear, talking about sex &mdash; the terrible silence that develops which no one attempts to break down for fear of the pain &bquo; [hi]that [/hi] &bquo;conversation would bring&equo;.

I think most Prisoners would say that the sex problem worried them less than they had expected it to, but that is not to say that it did not worry most people some of the time and some people all the time.

All couples face hurdles.
As the divorce statistics imply, most couples face their fair share of hurdles&ndash;in the first two years of marriage.
But facing up to conflicts and difficulties throughout marriage, be it in the early years or later, is the way of growth and strength.
According to Jesus, it is not possible to consider real foundations in marriage and in life without also considering the spiritual dimension to our lives.
This involves more than just values, but where you are going, your direction, your knowledge and understanding of God's purposes for you personally.
This may be why it is said that couples who pray together, stay together.
It is not as <head>simple</head>as it sounds, but a shared openness to God in life and in marriage makes every difference.

This model provides the conventional wisdom of public [pb] administration in liberal democracies.
Authority in a modern bureaucracy is hierarchical, running in a direct chain of command from superordinate to subordinate.
It is impersonal, and its rules are founded and followed upon a rational legal mode of legitimation.
Decisions must be made by the methodical application of rules to particular cases, not upon any private motivations.
Officials are recruited on merit criteria.

What puzzles a philosopher and taxes his mind to distraction may look completely irrelevant or quite obvious to a businessman.
The point is not to judge who is right, but to meet and resolve whatever doubt is a problem to a particular person. [/p] [p]

Reviewing plays a key part in the process of learning from experience.
If you don't review your performance then you have no data to carry forward into an improvement plan (see [hi]Action plans [/hi] on page 1).

The making and breaking of chemical bonds is associated with an energy barrier.
At normal temperatures most molecules jostle with enough thermal energy (as kinetic, vibrational and rotational energy) to overcome this barrier. [/p] [p]
So, molecular fragments, formed by irradiating a precursor, would instantly recombine.
Near absolute zero, however, molecules have much less thermal energy.
Therefore, even if two reactive fragments were side by side in a solid argon matrix, there would not necessarily be enough thermal energy to overcome the barrier and reform the precursor. [/p] [p]
To illustrate this, consider a group of compounds that has provided matrix isolation chemists with years of fun &mdash; the transition metal carbonyls.

The work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to
which Koehler set the words ``There 'll be no more work; there 'll be no
more worry'', matching the spiritual feeling of the jot.  This grew into
the song ``Big Time Comin '''.  By September 1940 the Suite had developed
into a collection of six songs, ``four spirituals, a dream, and a lullaby''.
The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied the American-Negro Suite and said
of it, ``Of all the many songs written by white composers and employing
what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music, these six songs
by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest.
Thoroughly modern in treatment, they are at the same time, full of
<head>simple</head> sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine
Negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average '

the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a belief that there was
order in the universe.  In their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic

[pb] The latter were all addressed to the pope or to foreign prelates.
French was therefore the language used by Edward's officials to address recipients as diverse as English local officers and Italian merchants.
Of 331 letters sent by Philippa of Hainault between 1330 and 1336, 203 were in Latin and 128 in French.
The predominance of Latin in this sample reflects the fact that many letters were addressed to bishops, and that Latin was used for the more <head>solemn</head> and formal instruments emanating from her chancery.

It is a lot easier these days, so make up a little cocktail of compatible systemic insecticide and fungicide, plus a drip or two of washing-up detergent to achieve a good wetting, in a small bowl, and [pb] swish the two leaves of each cutting in the solution so that they get a good wetting and protective coating.
Insert the cuttings by pushing each one down into the sand about 4&ndash;5 inches (10&ndash;12cm) apart and with the leaves at right angles to the line of the slit, so that growth emanating from the axillary buds grows out into free space between the rows, not into the cutting next door. [/p] [p]

One of the opponents must hold precisely 2 Spades containing the Jack.
I played out the King of Spades and the opponent in the East seat was fixed.
He held at that stage the Ace and Jack of Spades and 2 cards in Diamonds.
Whatever he did, I had the remaining tricks apart from the Ace of Spades. [/p] [p]
The second problem has a similar theme: [/p] [gap] [p]
In this case, however, a clue has been given to declarer in the earlier bidding.

The Sunday afternoon walk along the lanes was always interesting, even to very young children, for the high banks towered on either side of us, covered in wild flowers &mdash; campions, hemp agrimony, foxgloves, honeysuckle and many, many more.
The abundance of flowers meant butterflies, too, in a profusion which today, sadly, children never see.
There were handsome bumble-bees, ladybirds and many birds, including the occasional buzzard, hovering above some unsuspecting little creature.
I can hear the murmur of it all in my head, and smell the sweet air. [/p] [p]

The underlying assumption was that the likelihood of marriage between people from different villages drops off with increase in geographical distance between the villages.
The multi-dimensional scaling configuration resulting from processing the &bquo;degree of intermarriage&equo; values might therefore be expected to reflect geographical location of the villages.
Kendall was able to check his results to an extent, since much of his data related to villages whose location was known, and this gave him some confidence in suggesting the locations of the lost villages.

One of the most obvious practical needs we have is to be able to communicate.
We may therefore take as an example of our new dichotomy between the practical and the theoretical the teaching of English.
The state of English teaching in schools had obviously, by the late 1980s, become a cause of such radical complaint and discontent that it was not surprising to find a committee of inquiry set up to look into its proper aims and methods (The Kingham Committee, 1987).

The remainder of the chapter deals with some circumstances in which nurses are directly involved with assisting patients who have problems in maintaining a safe environment.
There are two sections.
The first of these is concerned with patients in hospital.
Florence Nightingale said &bquo;the hospital shall do the patient no harm&equo;.
Yet in most countries there is continuing concern about the number of patients who develop a hospital-acquired infection quite unrelated to the reason for their admission; about the accidents which happen to patients while they are in hospital; about the perennial danger of fire in hospitals; and about the dangers associated with the use of prescribed drugs in hospital.
In a way this is not surprising when one considers the size and function of a hospital, and the fact that hospitals are busy places: &bquo;busyness&equo; increases <head>stress</head> and tension, and errors and accidents are more likely to occur in such an atmosphere.

There is another way in which Eastern Europe can be seen as the prototype of things to come &mdash; the flow of refugees from East Germany and the German minorities in other countries to their rich brother.
In January 1990 alone there were 63,000 from East Germany and 38,000 from other East European countries; 100,000 in 1989 from the Soviet Union's 2 million-strong ethnic German population.
Most were economic refugees, but there were many who claimed to be environmental refugees leaving for the sake of their health.
The domestic political <head>stress</head> caused in West Germany by such an influx (which also of course, further undermined the East German economy, since many were skilled and professional people) was one very good reason why Bonn was prepared to pour aid into its neighbour.

Spoken language interpreting, because it takes place only in one medium (i.e. sound), ensures that two languages cannot be mixed directly, and the use of an interlanguage is discouraged from the earliest stages of language learning.
What is trained in the spoken language interpreter is the direct analysis of meaning and the active suppression of any interference effects from the production of the target language. [/p] [p]
In BSL interpreting, at present, many of the processes seem to be active which need not be and ought not to be.
The fact that the target language is not speech allows the interpreter to do something which is superficially easy: to shadow the source language without analysing it.
The effort in this makes it expedient that an output form is found as quickly as possible.
Under <head>stress</head> this becomes a simple word-for-sign or sign-for-word match which solves the immediate [pb] problem but does not give meaning.

Pre-existing disease of the coronary macro-circulation and perhaps microcirculation may be the most important factors affecting mortality from acute myocardial infarction in diabetic patients. [/p] [p]
Although there may not be any benefit on [pb] mortality from very good diabetic control immediately following myocardial infarction, it is clearly undesirable to have uncontrolled diabetes at this time.
An interesting feature that has emerged recently is the number of patients who are newly diagnosed as diabetic at the time of their myocardial infarction (Oswald et al, 1984).
This study suggested an overall prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes of 5.3 per cent in patients presenting with acute infarction.
It used to be thought that this was temporary diabetes resulting from the <head>stress</head> of infarction, but present data suggest that these patients have undiagnosed diabetes before infarction (Husband et al, 1983; Oswald et al, 1984). [/p] [p]

The amount of work this alerting action brought about was substantial because of the large number of Boeing 707/300 series aircraft flying in the world, all of which were necessarily involved.
Included in the 707/300 series was the 707/400 series fitted with Rolls Royce engines.
Although it was well established which major airlines were currently operating them, many others of these aircraft had been resold, sometimes several times over, to smaller companies.
Boeing had done their best to keep tabs on which aircraft had been sold to whom but some were no longer in service or had been damaged and discarded while one or two had even lost their identity, so that it was difficult to trace where they were and under whose jurisdiction they fell. [/p] [p]

We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel complementary DNA (CL100) corresponding to a messenger RNA that is highly inducible by oxidative stress and heat shock in human skin cells.
The cDNA contains an open reading frame specifying a protein of [hi]M [/hi] [hi]r [/hi] 39.3K with the structural features of a non-receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase and which has significant amino-acid sequence similarity to a Tyr/Ser-protein phosphatase encoded by the late gene [hi]H1 [/hi] of vaccinia virus.
The purified protein encoded by the CL100 open reading frame expressed in bacteria has intrinsic phosphatase activity.

Blood pressure is the pressure which the heart and arteries apply in order to squeeze the blood around the body.
When we are sitting or resting our blood pressure remains at a steady resting level.
This level increases depending on our activity and the demand for a surge of blood to be sent where it is needed, for instance to [pb] the muscles during exercise or to our brain when under pressure mentally.
As soon as we stop exerting ourselves the blood pressure returns to normal again. [/p] [p]
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is when the resting blood pressure is higher than normal.
Whilst high blood pressure is rare among young people it is common among those over thirty-five, no doubt caused by following an unhealthy lifestyle &mdash; eating too much, consuming too much alcohol, having too much salt in our food, smoking, lack of exercise, and suffering from too much <head>stress</head> .

To prevent the aircraft veering inwards from its circular path, there was to be a check cable on the outer wing tip, joined to a motor vehicle, which would drive around the outside of the circle during take-off.
The effects on the driver and vehicle can only be imagined, as driving in circles round a field, at say 40 mph, would be uncomfortable enough, let alone trying to match the take-off speed of a warplane. [/p] [p]

The realization that these three systems can interact, and the identification of the mechanisms involved, has only come within the past few years.
This new science has been given the rather daunting name of [hi]psychoneuroimmunology. [/hi] [/p] [p]
Among the discoveries made in psychoneuroimmunology is that stressful events can make the immune cells far less responsive to infection.
Bereavement can have devastating effects on our defensive cells, but even something as minor as taking an exam can make us more vulnerable to infection.
With long-term stress, it appears that a sense of being in control makes all the difference &mdash; feelings of helplessness and inability to improve matters are the most damaging.

Cohn summarizes these factors as follows: [ptr]However, parallel research specifically concerned with sexual abuse has identified risk factors which, while similar in some respects, also include important differences.
David Finkelhor (Finkelhor, 1986; Finkelhor and Baron, 1986) has reviewed a variety of American surveys of adults in order to assess the information provided about the relative risk of people from different backgrounds experiencing sexual abuse during childhood.

Protein [/head] [p]
Training breaks down muscle tissue and during rest periods the tissue is repaired and growth takes place if sufficient protein is available.
So how much protein do you need?
The most widely accepted figure is 0.6g (0.02oz) per pound of body-weight.
Thus a person weighing 154lb (70kg) would need 154 x 0.6 = 92.4g (3.23oz) per day.
This amount would maintain the person's health and keep his weight steady; to promote growth an extra 10&ndash;15g 0.35&ndash;0.5oz) per day would be necessary.

The cuckoo grabbed the side of the nest, picked up the reed warbler's egg in its beak and flew off.
The whole sequence of events lasted only eight seconds, and yet in that time the cuckoo had also managed to lay its own egg.
Most birds take about 20 minutes to lay an egg.
The ability of the cuckoo to lay its egg so quickly is a major adaptation of brood parasites. [/p] [p]
For their body size, cuckoos lay remarkably small eggs.
The average cuckoo's egg weighs just 3 g (&frac19; oz), while most birds of the same size lay eggs weighing about 10 g (&frac13; oz).
This must be a factor in the cuckoo's ability to lay its eggs so rapidly, but it also has other advantages.
One is that small eggs hatch sooner than large ones.
It is <head>vital</head>for the young cuckoo to hatch either before, or at the same time as, its nest mates.

Declining yews lose needles and develop in the same pattern as other conifers, and affected beech show specific changes to their branching structure.
The FoE study, published in October 1985 as [hi]The Final Report: Tree Dieback Survey [/hi], was based on 1,638 beech trees and 1,546 <head>yews</head> at over 700 sites.

The bark for the cancer drug is from trees harvested for timber, and loggers have to leave a 12 to 14 inch high stump.
Nearly 70 per cent of these stumps later resprout and grow once more. [/p] [p]
Bark is stripped from trees by hand, or with high-pressure water jets.
Then, paclitaxel is extracted from the bark in a complicated process. [/p] [p]
The drug companies are also investigating the possibility of using needles and twigs, obtained harmlessly during routine clipping, from other ornamental yew species.
Scientists are now trying to mimic natural paclitaxel, so the trees will not have to die. [/p] [p]

Much Wealden woodland has been managed as coppice, often in combination with standard trees, principally oak.
In the Low Weald much of the coppice is hazel, which was used primarily for the construction of sheep hurdles and in the building industry, but is now of little economic value.
Many of these woods have been abandoned or grubbed up for agricultural use.
The hazel coppices are particularly favoured by the large Sussex Nightingale population. [/p] [p]
The dominant tree in the High Weald where there are clay soils is also the pedunculate oak, but where sandy soils predominate the sessile oak ( [hi]Quercus petraea [/hi]) is well represented.
Other tree species commonly growing in association with oak include beech, silver birch ( [hi]Betula pendula [/hi]), mountain ash ( [hi]Sorbus aucuparia [/hi]), ash, holly, <head>yew</head> and Scots pine ( [hi]Pinus sylvestris [/hi]).

There are different types of galleries.
In many cases the buildings show the Nordic influence of the long house with farm buildings attached, sheltering man and his animals under the same roof, and the gallery may be on the house or barn.
It is believed that the galleries themselves are strongly influenced by the Nordic tradition.
Some galleries project from the first floor of the house; others are on barn buildings above the yard.
One has an outside stair, the only way to the first floor before an inside stair was built.
Some galleries are long, like those at <head>Yew</head> Tree and Monk Coniston, where a great (or walking) spinning wheel could be used, the spinner requiring space to draw her thread away from the great wheel and, turning, to reverse the wheel and walk back to wind the spun yarn on the bobbin.

Most of the downland woods are west of the Arun gap and, apart from plantations, beech ( [hi]Fagus sylvatica [/hi]) is the dominant tree, although it rarely regenerates, and where no replanting takes place ash ( [hi]Fraxinus excelsior [/hi]) quickly asserts itself.
The beech woods, especially, have little undergrowth, in which case they do not hold large bird populations and are often too young to support hole-nesting species such as woodpeckers.
The Woodland Survey indicates that there are no particular features of their bird populations, and certainly there are no characteristic species of beech woods in the way that Wood Warblers and Redstarts favour the open oak woods of the sand, or Nightingales the damp coppice of the clay.
<head>Yew</head> ( [hi]Taxus baccata [/hi]) commonly occurs in the ash woods, and on the National Nature Reserve at Kingley Vale there are large stands of yew which support good populations of common species, particularly Great Tit, Coal Tit, Chaffinch and thrushes.

Debate on 16 November was enlivened by a passionate defence of the schema from the Bishop of Faenza who attacked the Jesuit-run Biblical Institute, of which Bea had been rector.

The schema therefore reflected only one particular outlook, he argued, and should be rejected. This upset conservatives who insisted, inaccurately, that schemata could only be accepted or amended, not rejected.

This can be seen in the attitude adopted towards Nissan, Toyota and Honda, although the `national solution approach &quot; prevailed in the sale of Rover to British Aerospace rather than to a US multinational. It is certainly true that the huge costs of new model development, including the cost of meeting higher environmental standards, have forced many European car manufacturers to <head>collaborate</head> or merge. This process is being accelerated by the competition provided by Japanese firms. The trade balance of the motor industry has been in deficit since 1982 and in 1989, at 6.55 billion, accounted for 28 per cent of the UK visible trade deficit of 23.1 billion. From this it may be seen that the health of the motor industry is critical to the health of the British economy.

Awareness of personal attitudes to ageing has to start young. We need to mix schoolchildren and older people more.

It depends how it is done. Tea parties can be mutually enjoyable; they don't have to be events where `active &quot; children simply wait on `passive &quot; older people.

TUSCANY Nothing could surpass the exquisite beauty of the countryside of Tuscany. At any time of the year, if you meander into the hilltowns, your senses will be rewarded.

Vineyardlaced fields are brilliant and vibrant in promise and delivery; dusky grey-green olive groves <head>dress</head> the hillsides and pines and cypresses appear to point out the landscape. But this alone is not what we offer you. This area has within her villages and retreats some of the finest pensiones and most lovely villas in the world.

Or they <head>drift</head> into vice, and do even that too late, so that they are too old to relish the lustiness of sin.

As you will notice, it isn't really different from its method of growing, except that the growing parts become physically detached from one another.

It reproduces by releasing single-celled spores which <head>drift</head> off in the sea and grow into new plants. These spores are just cells of the plant like any others.

The Japanese discount rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial banks. After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit -- $10.77 billion  from a revised $8.24 billion  in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13, the Federal Reserve relaxed short-term interest rates,  knocking fed funds from around 9% to 8 3\/4 %.

The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism,  vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that  has emerged within governmental bureaucracy. But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization (so cumbersome  it can not constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need  to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ), unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism, the motivation  to operate for the benefit of society as a whole.

The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that  are likely  to govern the debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude, and the ability  of each side  to counter the other's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere. The action in Pennsylvania, for example, will follow last week's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature   to enact restrictions on abortions in that state, and the vote  here in Washington by the House  to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who  are victims of rape or incest.
But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that, along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure, is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges <head>faced</head> by this resurgent movement.

Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal  is  to be nothing more than average. Westridge Capital's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing.

Futures Contracts -- Obligations  to buy (for those who  have purchased a contract) or deliver (for those who  sold one) a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date.

They can ignore the S&amp;P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks, such as smaller companies, those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry, state or country. With today's computer-driven program trading techniques, index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&amp;P 500.
Futures and options also make it possible to build &quot; synthetic &quot; index funds that don't actually own a single share of stock, but can produce returns that <head>match</head> or exceed the broad stock market.

Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine,  lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without  disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and insists that after  leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days   to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, after which the bottle may be gently eased  to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .
In France, when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and <head>serve</head> truly fine old red wines, one visits the restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them.

Taking precipitously to his heels and hurriedly joining the Coldstream Guards, he eventually settled in East Anglia, where he married and where his literary son George was born in 1803.

The invitation arose in a dramatic way, the sequel to a tremendous storm at Great Yarmouth where George Borrow was then resident. During its course Borrow was instrumental in saving at least one man from drowning and, as a result, was mentioned in the Plymouth press.

Each time you pick one up you will be checking which rod it is and adjusting your actions to suit that particular rod. Sometimes you have to strike very quickly, such as when fish are finicky and you have to respond to twitch bites.

It is not quite so important to duplicate the reel, but it is still wise, if only for the fact that your spare spools are interchangeable on both reels.

Canine behavioural problems are well recognized, and a specialist in this field may also be able to help you with a specific concern. If your vet recommends contacting such a specialist, you may well be in a position to recover the cost from a pet health insurance plan, depending on the wording of the policy. You can also turn to a professional dog trainer, who will take your dog and <head>train</head> it for you. Unfortunately, this is not always as successful as it might be, largely because your dog comes to relate to the trainer's commands and so then proves more reluctant to follow your instructions.

Children may learn to pass urine and faeces in it but accidents will still happen when they are preoccupied in play or are in a place where they do not know where the lavatory is. By the age of 3 years most children can voluntarily initiate emptying a full bladder and later a partly full bladder. The age at which a mother starts to toilet <head>train</head> her child is unlikely to have much effect on the age at which the child will be fully trained. Drillien  1964 found that children at 2 years of age who were potted early were neither wetter nor dryer, cleaner nor dirtier than children trained later. Similarly the Newsons  1965 could find no relationship between early or late training and reliability or unreliability at 4 years of age.

I would not advise any female competitor to rely upon a firm bra as a means of protection, because all that does is hold the breasts so that they can't move freely under impact.

CARE OF BOOTS Always wash dirty leather boots with clean water, using a brush to remove any mud. Dry them gently, with newspaper inside to take up excess moisture, and never subject them to direct heat. Do not try to force-dry them in front of a fire or on a radiator. When the boots are dry, <head>treat</head> them with a proprietary wax, such as Nikwax or Granger's G-Wax  both of these are recommended by the major boot manufacturers. Boots which have been factory-treated and given a waterproof finish should not normally be given a wax treatment when new, but should be treated with ordinary shoe polish. Always follow the manufacturers ' instructions.

Soot solution In those days, a bag of soot purchased from the local chimney sweep was a valuable aid to bug control.

But it is not necessary to look so far afield or so long ago for examples of rivers which have refused to obey the dictates of engineers. In 1864 the river Ystwyth in Wales was straightened to run parallel to a railway track. In 1969 it was back again on its <head>wandering</head> course, and was engineered cheaply back into line by dredging out the gravel shoals which were causing it to wander. However, this did not turn out to be such a cheap solution in the long run, since it set up conditions of even greater instability, necessitating repeated operations every two years.5 Major work on the river Taff and the river Usk in South Wales, carried out in the early 1980s, has precipitated extensive and unforeseen repair bills.

At the end of January Pop decided to go south to our villages, and sent us up the Irrawaddy to Maymyo.

It is over-stimulation; the mind can not find peace and quiet. On the other hand, Mozart and Bach bring harmony and lightness, as well as a state of calm and order. Watching the late-night news fills our minds with concern and misery, and then we go to sleep with these thoughts. Idleness can also be an enemy of rest and relaxation. If we allow ourselves to <head>wander</head> aimlessly with our thoughts and allow our bodies to stagnate, we are straying towards negative thoughts and ill health. It is the same law which states that without energy everything falls apart. Chaos is a negative state and idleness of the mind and body encourages it. Happiness, peace of mind and a rested body are essentially energized states.

Solitary The adult males and females live alone and meet only in the breeding season. After courtship and copulation they split up again and have no further relations until the next season. The female deals with the young without the help of the male, or in certain cases the male rears the young without the help of the female. The solitary adults may <head>wander</head> over vaguely defined home ranges, or they may restrict themselves to clearly defined and defended territories. Animals that fall into this general category include many territorial fish, such as the river bullhead, many reptiles, especially snakes, a few birds, such as the ruff, and many mammals, such as bears, pandas and raccoons.
